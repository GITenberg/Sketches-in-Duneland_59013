<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the dune region that extends along the
wild coasts of Lake Michigan, and in the
back country contiguous to it, is a land of
allurement.</p>

<p>The strange human characters, whose little
drift-wood shanties are scattered along the shore,
and among the sandhills, and whose isolated
retreats are further inland, are difficult to become
acquainted with, except in a most casual
way. They look upon the chance wayfarer with
suspicion and disfavor.</p>

<p>Readers of “The Dune Country” will remember
“Old Sipes,” “Happy Cal,” and “Catfish
John,” the old derelicts living along the beach,
further accounts of whose “doin’s” are in the
following pages. As portraits of these worthies
have already appeared, they are omitted in this
volume. New characters are introduced, who,
it is hoped, will be, as cordially welcomed.</p>

<p>The region is of important historical interest.
Narratives of early exploration, and primitive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
Indian lore associated with it, have filled many
pages of American history. The Pottowattomies
have gone, but the romance of the vanished
race still lingers among the silent hills. While
many poetic legends, of unknown antiquity, have
survived the red men, the Indian stories in these
pages are entirely fanciful, except as to environment.</p>

<p>The nature loving public will be fortunate if
the organized efforts succeed, which are being
made to preserve the country of the dunes as a
national park. In compliance with a resolution
of the Senate, the Department of the Interior,
through the able assistant to the Secretary, Mr.
Stephen T. Mather, has recently made an exhaustive
report on the subject, which is most
favorable to the project. Momentous events
have, for the time being, eclipsed minor considerations,
and this, as well as many other
measures for the public good, must wait until
the shadow of the Hun has passed.</p>

<p>It is only within the past few years that the
picturesque quality of the region has become
known to lovers of American landscape, who
are now lured by its varied attractions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<p>The country is of immeasurable value to
botanists, ornithologists, and investigators in other
fields of natural science.</p>

<p>The Audubon societies are taking a deep
interest in its preservation. Those of us for
whom it is not necessary to slaughter songsters
for the decoration of our hats, and who believe
that nature’s beautiful feathered messengers
should not be made to bleed and suffer for thoughtless
vanity, can sympathize with any movement
that will contribute to their welfare. As
a refuge for migratory birds, the proposed preserve
would be invaluable. It is within the
Mississippi valley flight zone, and during the
periods of migration the bird life in the dune
country is abundant, but unfortunately finds
little protection among the wooded hills.</p>

<p>The wild flowers also suffer from vandal hands.
Many armfuls of them are ruthlessly picked
and carried away, preventing further propagation.
A human being is only partially emancipated
from barbarism, who cannot look upon a
beautiful thing without wanting to pick it or
kill it. Primitive savagery would not be attracted
by beauty at all. Partial development
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of the love of beauty suggests its selfish acquirement,
while further enlightenment teaches us
to cherish and preserve it. The destruction of
the wild flowers, and the use of bird plumage for
personal adornment, is modified barbarism. We
cannot be fully civilized until we are able to love
these beautiful things in their natural habitats,
without temptation to injure them.</p>

<p>To the botanist, the country is a treasure
house. Almost, if not all, of the flora indigenous
to the temperate zone, is found within its borders.</p>

<p>The flowers have a kingdom in the dunes.
From the secluded nooks and fertile crevices,
from among the shadows of the trees, and along
the margins of the marshes and little pools,
their silent songs of color go out over the landscapes.
In no form is beauty so completely
expressed, and in no form is it so accessible to us.</p>

<p>The sketches in this volume are culled from
the experiences and reflections of many happy
days that were spent in this mystic land. In
such a retreat we may find refuge from the town,
from the nerve-racking noise and stifling smoke,
and from the artificialities and the social illusions
that becloud our daily lives.</p>

THE DREAM JEWEL</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> tribe of the sturgeon was speeding
southward over the rock-strewn floors
of the inland sea. In the van of the
swimming host its leader bore a wondrous stone.
From it multicolored beams flashed out through
the dim waters and into unsounded depths.
Shapes, still and ghostly, with waving fins and
solemn orbs, stared at the passing glow and vanished.
Phantom-like forms faded quickly into
dark recesses, and frightened schools of small fish
fled away over pale sandy expanses. Clouds of
fluttering gulls and terns followed the strange
light that gleamed below the waves. Migrating
birds, high in the night skies, wheeled with plaintive
calls, for this new radiance was not of the
world of wings and fins.</p>

<p>The wonder stone was being carried out of the
Northland. For ages untold it had reposed in
the heart of a stupendous glacier, that crept over
the region of the great lakes from the roof of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
world&mdash;from that vast frozen sea of desolation
that is ghastly white and endless&mdash;under the
corona of the Northern Lights.</p>

<p>From a cavern deep in ice, its prismatic rays
had illumined the crystal labyrinths during the
slow progress of the monster of the north, grinding
and scarring the earth in its path of devastation.</p>

<p>The radiance from the stone was ineffable.
Such color may have swept into the heavens on
the world’s first morning, when the Spirit moved
over the face of the waters, or have trembled
in the halo at the Creation, when cosmos was
evolved out of elemental fires.</p>

<p>It glowed in the awful stillness of its prison,
untouched by the primeval storms that raged
before the mammoths trod the earth, and before
men of the stone age had learned the use of fire.</p>

<p>Many centuries after the greater part of the
gigantic ice sheet had yielded to balmy airs, its
frowning ramparts lingered along the wild shores
of the north. The white silence was broken by
reverberations from crumbling masses that crashed
down the steeps into the billows that broke against
the barrier. In one of the pieces the stone was
borne away. The luminous lump drifted with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
winds. It was nuzzled by curious rovers of the
blue waters that rubbed gently along its sides and
basked in the refulgence. With the final dissolution
of the fragment, the stone was released.</p>

<p>In quest of new feeding grounds, the sturgeon
had explored these frigid depths, and, after privation
and fruitless wanderings, had gathered for
the long retreat to a warmer clime. Their leader
beheld the blazing gem falling, like a meteor, before
him. With fateful instinct he seized it and
moved grimly on. The gray horde saw the light
from afar and streamed after it, as warriors might
have followed the banner of a hero.</p>

<p>Through many miles of dark solitudes the bearer
of the stone led his adventurous array. Swiftly
moving fins took the sturgeon to waters where
nature had been more merciful.</p>

<p>The roaring surf lines of the southern shore
washed vast flat stretches of sand that were bleak
and sterile, for no living green relieved the monotonous
wilds.</p>

<p>A few Indians had been driven by warfare into
this dreary land. Their wigwams were scattered
along the coast, where they eked out a precarious
existence from the spoil of the waters.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>When the sturgeon came their lives were quickened
with new energy. With their bark canoes
and stone spears they found many victims among
the tired fish. A wrinkled prophet, who had communed
with the gods of his people, in a dream,
had foretold the sending of a luminous stone, by
a sturgeon, that would mark the beginning of an
era of prosperity and happiness for his tribe.
There was rejoicing when the lustre was seen
among the waves. In the belief that the promised
gift of the manitous had come, and the prophecy
was fulfilled, the big fish was pursued with eagerness
and finally captured. The long-awaited prize
was carried in triumph to the lodge of the chief.
The red men gathered in solemn council, and
honors were heaped upon the aged seer whose vision
had become true. After long deliberation,
Flying Fawn, the loveliest maiden of the tribe, was
appointed keeper of the stone. The lithe and
beautiful barbarian child of nature clasped it to
her budding breast, and departed into the wastes.
With an invocation to her gods for its protection,
she hid their precious gift far beyond the reach
of prying eyes.</p>

<p>The winds carried myriads of flying grains to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the chosen spot. They came in thin veils and
little spirals over the barrens, and gathered, with
many sweeps and swirls, into the mound that rose
over the resting place of the stone. The army of
the silent sands had become its guardian, for
nevermore was its hiding place known.</p>

<p>The winds and the years sculptured the shifting
masses into strange and bewildering forms. Trees,
grasses, and flowers grew, and the hilltops were
crowned with perennial garlands. The green sanctuaries
were filled with melody. The forests
teemed with game and the red men were in a land
of plenty.</p>

<p>The Country of the Dunes had come into being.
Somewhere deep in its bosom shines the Dream
Jewel. Like “The Great Carbuncle,” its fervid
splendor beams from a fount unknown. Its iridescence
flashes from the distant dunes at sunset.
It is in the twilight afterglows, on the sapphire
waters of the lake on summer days, and in the
fairylands that are pictured in the pools. It glorifies
dull winter landscapes with skies of infinite
hues, and glances from twisted trunks of ancient
pines on hills that defy the storms. It pulsates
in star reflections that haunt the margins of wet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sands, and where crescent moons touch the waves
that toss on night horizons. Its tinge is in the
tender leaves and petals of the springtime, and in
the flush of autumn’s robes. We see its elusive
tints through vistas in the dusk, and in the purple
mystery that fills the shadowy places, for the
Dream Jewel is Beauty, and they who know not
its holy light must walk in darkness.

A ROMANCE OF MT. TOM</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Before</span> strangers came into the land,
bringing with them a prosaic nomenclature,
there was no Mt. Tom. When the
early white explorers crossed the southern end of
Lake Michigan in their frail canoes, they saw,
from far out on the water, dim irregular filaments
of yellow that stretched along the horizon. There
was a bold accent in the far-flung line of distant
coast, an ancient landmark of a primitive race.
The noble promontory that lifted its royal brow
from among the contours of the sand hills&mdash;the
monarch of the range&mdash;was called Wud-ju-na-gow,
or Sand Mountain, by the red men.</p>

<p>Its top was the highest point along the great
sweep of shore that bordered the country of the
dunes. In past centuries its sand had been slowly
piled by the shifting winds. Eventually the sand
grasses rooted themselves, and, in succeeding
years, the trees grew. Wud-ju-na-gow became a
“fixed dune,” no longer subject to the caprices of
the winds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>The slopes were robed with vegetation. Stately
pines, spruces, and cedars flourished among the
dense forest growth that reached almost to the
summit. Here the trees were smaller, and bare
patches of yellow were visible against the sky-line,
from which wispy wreaths of sand would
spiral up in the air currents on windy days.</p>

<p>In the autumn the groups of green conifers
made dark accents in the expanse of red and gold
that draped Wud-ju-na-gow’s massive form.
Flowers grew lavishly along the steep slopes.
The wild life sought refuge in the impassable
thickets and tall timber. Hawks and eagles
soared above the woods with watchful eyes and
dropped down into them for furtive prey. Hordes
of noisy crows circled over the tree-tops and
around the wind-swept summit. Wolves and
other marauders crept stealthily through the
undergrowth at night. Startled deer leaped from
quiet hiding places and fled from suspicious
sounds and odors. Partridges thrived in the
patches of brush and tangled grape-vines, in spite
of many enemies. Beady eyes peered out from
under fallen trunks. The hunters and the hunted
followed their destinies among the shadows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>A Pottawattomie village had flourished for
many years on a low ridge back of the hills, near
Wud-ju-na-gow. Just below the village a small
creek, fed by springs, wound through the open
woods and reached the lake through a deep ravine.
The high hills protected the lodges from the north
winds and violent storms from the lake. About
sixty bark wigwams were strung along the ridge.</p>

<p>The young men hunted through the hills and
usually had no difficulty in keeping the village
supplied with meat. They carried their birch-bark
canoes through the ravine to the lake and
varied the food supplies with sturgeon and other
fish. In times of plenty the game and fish not
needed for immediate use were smoked and stored
for winter consumption. Small patches of corn
were scattered through the fertile open spaces
away from the creek. The women gossiped over
their domestic concerns, the men loitered along
the hillside, and the little community lived in
peace, with no troubles but those that nature has
laid upon all her children. In their uncivilized
state they were spared the miseries of temperament,
and the refined tortures, as well as the joys,
of more highly developed mentality. Their primitive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
needs were provided for. Food was abundant
and the red men were contented&mdash;if there be
real contentment in the world.</p>

<p>After a long period of prosperity there came a
summer of drought. Pitiless heat and breathless
skies shrivelled the leaves, dried up the streams
and ponds, and brought suffering to the live
things. In the autumn the parched land had
yielded up its vibrant life. Instead of the mellow
golds and crimsons, there were grays and neutral
browns. The voices of the forest were hushed.
The fall flowers did not come. The willows and
tall grasses drooped in sorrow, for a blight had
come upon the land. Day after day the blood-red
sun went below the sharp rim of the horizon
without promise to the faded hills.</p>

<p>Smoke appeared far in the southwest and a
black pall crept into the sky overhead. Before
many hours there was a vague unrest in the
woods. There were strange noises among the
withered trees and dried marshes. The wild life
was fleeing eastward. At night a baleful glare
tinged the crests of the dunes and reflected from
swiftly moving wings above them.</p>

<p>With the coming of the wind stifling smoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
crept through the woods. Soon the crackling lines
of flame came, writhing and roaring through the
dry timber. There were muffled cries from tiny
furred fugitives in the matted grasses in the low
places. Noble landscapes were being scourged by
demons. Nature’s cool cloisters and her dream
cathedrals were on fire.</p>

<p>There is a heart-felt grief that comes with the
burning of the trees. The sacrilege of their destruction
touches us more deeply if we have lived
among them, and learned that with them have
been builded the real kingdoms of the earth. In
them we may find reflection of all human emotion,
and for the subtly attuned soul, they have emotion
of their own.</p>

<p>The terrified dwellers along the creek fled to
the beach, and, with awe-stricken faces watched
the march of the flames through the country.
They saw the flashes from the cedars, pines, and
spruces shoot high into clouds of smoke and flying
sparks, and heard the crackling of countless
trunks and branches that quivered in torment on
the blazing hills.</p>

<p>By some fortuitous chance&mdash;perhaps a temporary
veering of the air currents&mdash;the ravine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
through which the little creek found its way, was
spared. A portion of the timber on the slopes of
Wud-ju-na-gow was also untouched, but everywhere
else was desolation. The blackened and
smouldering expanse carried dismay into the
hearts of the horror-stricken groups huddled near
the mouth of the stream. Most of their primitive
belongings had been rescued, but their future looked
as dark as the grim landscapes around them.</p>

<p>It was late in the season. The fishing in the
lake had been unusually poor, and there was no
living thing among the forest ruins that could
be used for food. The stores that had been saved
would last but a short time and there was an
appalling fear of famine.</p>

<p>Many anxious hours were spent in deliberation.
Believing that Omnipotent wrath had destroyed
everything except the sands and the waters of the
lake, the bewildered Indians saw no ray of hope.
The calamity had fallen with crushing force. The
vengeance of evil gods was upon them. Their few
frail canoes could not carry all of them on the
lake. The range of smoking hills that swept
away along the curving beach-lines seemed to offer
no path of refuge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>Young Wa-be-no-je had listened intently to all
of the discussions, and had pondered deeply over
the desperate straits of his people. He bore the
Indian name of the white marsh hawk. He was
nearly nineteen. His proud father, a shrewd old
hunter and trapper, had taught him the craft and
lore of the woods. He sat near little Taheta, the
playmate of his childhood. With ripening years
love had come into their lives. Before the great
fire they had begun to talk of a wigwam of their
own, but now that dark hours had come they knew
that they would have to wait.</p>

<p>Wa-be-no-je rose from a log on which they
had been sitting, near a group of the older men,
stepped forward and volunteered to follow the
fire and find the game. With care the scant
supply of food would be sufficient to support his
companions for two moons. If he did not return
by the end of that time they would understand
that his quest had failed.</p>

<p>A few simple preparations were made for his
journey. With forebodings in her heart, with love
light shining through her tears, little Taheta saw
him depart into the charred wastes on his errand
of salvation. No mailed knight ever rode out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
upon the path to glory with brighter eyes upon
him than those that glowed under the long lashes
of the Pottawattomie maiden, as she gazed longingly
after him from the edge of the ravine. She
watched his lithe, sinewy figure as he bravely
strode away and faded into the distance. She
went back in sorrow and began with the others
to endure patiently the long wait and suspense
which they knew was inevitable before the hunter’s
return.</p>

<p>It was agreed that every night at sundown a
fire should be built on the lofty top of Wud-ju-na-gow,
and kept burning until dawn, during Wa-be-no-je’s
absence. If he was where he could see
this light, he would know that his people were
still in the ravine, and in the darkness it would
take the place of burned landmarks to guide him
on his return journey. Ten members of the little
band, including Taheta, were to perform this duty,
and each night one of them climbed the zigzag
trail to the sandy top, kindled the beacon fire,
watched and replenished it until sunrise, and
returned.</p>

<p>From miles away the young hunter could see
the tiny light against the sky. When its glow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
was very bright he knew that one he loved was
near it. He tramped on through the ashes and
débris for many days. At night he climbed to
some high spot and slept. One afternoon he
reached a sandy stretch where the trees were
scattered and there were few grasses. The wind
had evidently lulled when the fire reached this
area for the burnt places ended. He began to find
the game trails leading from them, which he followed
for several days. The signs became fresher,
and one morning his eyes were gladdened by the
sight of deer and buffalo peacefully grazing beyond
a small river that he had never seen before.</p>

<p>Fearing that the animals might move on and
be beyond reach before he could return and obtain
help, he decided to kill as many as possible and
preserve and hide the meat. Its transportation
would then be a comparatively simple matter,
and he was sure that he could secure enough for
the winter’s supply.</p>

<p>He set cautiously to work. The noiseless arrows
brought down one of the buffalo and a deer the
first day. He killed no more until this meat was
cut into little strips, strung on many switches,
smoked over fires of dried leaves and dead wood,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and thoroughly dried in the sun. He enlarged a
small cave under some rocks by digging away the
sand. He made a floor of dead leaves inside on
which to pile his stores, and carefully walled up
the opening with stones to protect the precious
contents from the wolves and other prowlers.
The game was gradually moving away, but before
it disappeared the cave was well filled and there
was more than enough to last his people for a year.</p>

<p>The long dry period was now broken by a
heavy rain storm which lasted for several days.
The arid earth drank of the falling waters; the
blackness and ruin upon the land were washed as
with tears of atonement. The streams again
flowed and the pools and marshes that give life
and joy to the wild things were filled.</p>

<p>When the skies cleared Wa-be-no-je piled more
rocks over the entrance to the cave and started
homeward with a light heart. Weary miles were
traversed before he could see the faint light on
the horizon against the sky at night. During two
nights he heard wolves howling in the distance,
and the next night they were much closer. They
gradually closed in toward him and he knew that
danger had come. He had but two good arrows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
The others were lost or broken. He came to a
small stream and waded it for a mile or so to
throw his hungry followers off his trail, but they
soon found it again. Yellow eyeballs reflected his
firelight while he slept. Once he loosed one of
the precious arrows to save his life. The pack
immediately fell upon their wounded comrade
and devoured him. Their hunger was only partially
appeased and they kept close to Wa-be-no-je
until the following evening. He knew that unless
he could find some means of shaking them off he
would never see Taheta or his people again. He
decided to attempt to pick his way through the
end of a wide marsh, believing that his pursuers
would not follow him into the water. If he could
get safely across, he would be able to elude them.</p>

<p>The swamp was full of quaking bogs, and near
the middle the water was quite deep. His progress
was impeded by the soft mud and decayed
vegetation on the bottom, and the further he went
the chances became more desperate. One foot
sank suddenly in the soft ooze and then the other.
He could neither retreat nor go ahead. He had
reached a mass of quicksand, and with every attempt
to extricate himself he sank a little lower.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
He clutched the ends of a few sodden grasses and
held them for some time, but the stagnant murky
waters slowly closed over him and he was gone.</p>

<p>The baffled wolves howled along the margins of
the marsh for a while but soon disappeared, like
all enemies whose quarry has met finality. The
little fire on the horizon flared up brightly, as
though fresh sticks had been piled upon it, and
gleamed through the darkness brighter than ever
before. It faded away in the gray of the morning
and its watcher followed the steep trail down the
side of Wud-ju-na-gow to rest.</p>

<p>Wa-be-no-je’s silent departure from the world
left hardly a ripple in the marsh. It is human to
cherish the hope, or fondly believe, that some store
of gold, or grandeur of achievement&mdash;some sculptured
monument, or service to mankind&mdash;will
stand at our place of exit and be eloquent while
the ages last, but the Waters of Oblivion hide well
their secrets. Beneath them are neither pride nor
vanity. The primordial slime from which we came
reclaims without pomp or jewelled vesture, and
if there be a Great Beyond, poor Wa-be-no-je
may reach it from the quicksand as safely as he
who becomes dust within marble walls.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>The early snows came and the nightly fires on
Wud-ju-na-gow still glowed. Only one guardian
sat beside them, for Wa-be-no-je’s people now believed
that he would never return. Hope still
abided in Taheta’s loyal heart, and night after
night she climbed the shelving steeps and built
her fire. One cold, stormy night she sat huddled
in her blanket and listened to the north wind.
The snow swirled around her and toward morning
the light was gone. The next day they found
the rigid little form in the blanket and buried it
below the ashes of her fire.</p>

<p>Today the Fireweed, that ever haunts the burnt
places, lifts its slender stalk above the spot, and
it may be that the soul of faithful Taheta lurks
among the tender pink blossoms&mdash;a halo that
may be seen from the dark waters of the distant
marsh.

THE HERON’S POOL</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> pool was far back from the big
marshes through which the lazy current
of the river wound. It was in one of
those secluded nooks that the seeping water finds
for itself when it would hide in secret retreats and
form a little world of its own. It was bordered
by slushy grasses and small willows; its waters
spread silently among the bulrushes, lily pads
and thick brush tangles. A few ghostly sycamores
and poplars protruded above the undergrowth,
and the intricate network of wild grape-vines
concealed broken stumps that were mantled
with moss. The placid pool was seldom ruffled,
for the dense vegetation protected it from the
winds. Wandering clouds were mirrored in its
limpid depths. Water-snakes made silvery trails
across it. Sinister shadows of hawks’ wings sometimes
swept by, and often the splash of a frog sent
little rings out over the surface. Opalescent
dragon-flies hovered among the weeds and small
turtles basked in the sun-light along the margins.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>The Voices of the Little Things were in this
abode of tranquillity&mdash;the gentle sounds that fill
nature’s sanctuaries with soft music. There were
contented songs of feathered visitors, distant cries
of crows beyond the tree-tops, faint echoes of a
cardinal, rejoicing in the deep woods, and the
drowsy hum of insects&mdash;the myriad little tribes
that sing in the unseen aisles of the grasses.</p>

<p>One spring a gray old heron winged his way
slowly over the pool, and, after a few uncertain
turns over the trees, wearily settled among the
rushes. After stalking about in the labyrinth of
weeds along the shallow edges for some time,
he took his station on a dead branch that protruded
from the water near the shore, and
solemnly contemplated his surroundings.</p>

<p>His plumage was tattered, and he bore the record
of the years he had spent on the marshy
wastes along the river. His eye had lost its lustre,
and the delicate blue that had adorned the wings
of his youth had faded to a pale ashen gray. The
tired pinions were slightly frayed&mdash;the wings
hung rather loosely in repose, and the lanky legs
carried scars and crusty gray scales that told of
vicissitudes in the battle for existence. He looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
long and curiously at a round white object on the
bottom near his low perch. The round object had
a history, but its story did not come within the
sphere of the heron’s interests, and he returned
to his meditations on the gnarled limb. He may
have dreamed of far-off shores and happy homes
in distant tree-tops. A memory of a mate that
flew devotedly by his side, but could not go all
the way, may have abided with him. The peace
of windless waters brooded in this quiet haven.
It was a refuge from the storms and antagonisms
of the outer world, its store of food was abundant,
and in it he was content to pass his remaining
days.</p>

<p>When night came his still figure melted into
the darkness. A fallen luna moth, whose wet
wings might faintly reflect the starlight, would
sometimes tempt him, and he would listen languidly
to the lonely cries of an owl that lived in
one of the sycamores. The periodic visits of
coons and foxes, that prowled stealthily in the
deep shadows, and craftily searched the wet
grasses for small prey, did not disturb him. They
well knew the power of the gray old warrior’s
cruel bill. All his dangerous enemies were far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
away. The will-o’-the-wisps that spookily and
fitfully hovered along the tops of the rushes, and
the erratic flights of the fire-flies, did not mar his
serenity. He was spending his old age in comfort
and repose.</p>

<p>There is a certain air, or quality, about certain
spots which is indefinable. An elusive and intangible
impression, an idea, or a story, may become
inseparably associated with a particular place.
With a recurrence of the thought, or the memory
of the story there always comes the involuntary
mental picture of the physical environment with
which it is interwoven. This association of
thought and place is in most cases entirely individual,
and is often a subtle sub-consciousness&mdash;more
of a relationship of the soul, than the
mind, to such an environment. Something in or
near some particular spot that imparts a peculiar
and distinctive character to it, or inspires some
dominant thought or emotion, constitutes the
“genius” of that place. The Genius of the Place
may be a legend, an unwritten romance, a memory
of some event, an imaginary apparition, an
unaccountable sound, the presence of certain
flowers or odors, a deformed tree, a strange inhabitant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
or any thought or thing that would always
bring it to the mind.</p>

<p>When the heron came to the pool the Genius
of the Place was old Topago, a chief of the Pottawattomies.
A great many years ago he lived in
a little hut, rudely built of logs and elm bark, on
an open space a few hundred feet from the pool.
The fortunes of his tribe had steadily declined,
and their sun was setting. After the coming of
the white man, war and sickness had decimated
his people. The wild game began to disappear
and hunger stalked among the little villages. The
old chief brooded constantly over the sorrows of
his race. As the years rolled on his melancholy
deepened. He sought isolation in the deep woods
and built his lonely dwelling near the pool to pass
his last years in solitude. His was the anguish of
heart that comes when hope has fled. Occasionally
one of the few faithful followers who were
left would come to the little cabin and leave supplies
of corn and dried meat, but beyond this he
had no visitors. His contact with his tribe had
ceased.</p>

<p>One stormy night, when the north wind howled
around the frail abode, and the spirits of the cold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
were sighing in the trunks of the big trees, the
aged Indian sat over his small fire and held his
medicine bag in his shrivelled hands. Its potent
charm had carried him safely through many perils,
and he now asked of it the redemption of his
people. That night the wind ceased and he felt
the presence of his good manitous in the darkness.
They told him that the magic of his medicine was
still strong. If he would watch the reflections in
the pool, there would sometime appear among them
the form of a crescent moon that would foretell
a great change in the fortunes of his race, but he
must see the reflection with his own eyes.</p>

<p>In the spring, as soon as the ice had melted, he
began his nightly vigils at the foot of an ancient
pine that overhung the water. Through weary
years he gazed with dimmed eyes upon the infinite
and inscrutable lights that gleamed and trembled
in the pool. Many times he saw the new
moon shine in the twilights of the west, and saw
the old crescent near the horizon before the dawn,
but no crescent was ever reflected from the zenith
into the still depths below. Only the larger moons
rode into the night skies above him. His aching
heart fought with despair and distrust of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
tribal gods. The wrinkles deepened on his wan
face. The cold nights of spring and fall bent
the decrepit figure and whitened the withered
locks. Time dealt harshly with the faithful
watcher, nobly guarding his sacred trust.</p>

<p>One spring a few tattered shreds of a blanket
clung to the rough roots. Heavy snow masses
around the pine had slipped into the pool sometime
during the winter, and carried with them a
helpless burden. The melting ice had let it into
the sombre depths below. The birds sang as
before, the leaves came and went, and Mother
Nature continued her eternal rhythm.</p>

<p>During a March gale the ancient pine tottered
and fell across the open water. In the grim procession
of the years it became sodden and gradually
settled into the oozy bottom. Only the
gnarled and decayed branch&mdash;the perch of the
old heron&mdash;remained above the surface.</p>

<p>One night in early fall, when there was a tinge
of frost in the air, and the messages of the dying
year were fluttering down to the water from the
overhanging trees, the full moon shone resplendent
directly above the pool. The old heron
turned his tapering head up toward it for a moment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
plumed his straggling feathers for a while,
nonchalantly gazed at the white skull that caught
the moon’s light below the water near his perch,
and relapsed into immobility. A rim of darkness
crept over the edge of the moon, and the earth’s
shadow began to steal slowly across the silver
disk. The soft beams that glowed on the trees
and grasses became dimmed and they retreated
into the shadows. The darkened orb was almost
eclipsed. Only a portion of it was left, but far
down in the chill mystery of the depths of the
pool, among countless stars, was reflected a crescent
moon.</p>

<p>The magic of Topago’s medicine was still potent.
The hour for the redemption of the red
man had come, but he was no more. The mantle
of the Genius of the Place had fallen upon the
old heron. He was the keeper of the secret of
his pool.

THE STORY OF THE STREAM</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> bistre-colored waters of French Creek
seep sluggishly out of the ancient peat
beds far away in the country back of
the dunes. Countless tiny rivulets of transparent
golden brown creep through the low land among
the underbrush and mingle with the gentle current
that whispers in the deep grasses, ripples
against decayed branches and fallen trunks, hides
under masses of gnarled roots and projecting
banks, and enters the long sinuous ravine that
winds through the woods and sand-hills. The
ravine ends abruptly at the broad shore of the
lake. The stream spreads out over the beach
and tints the incoming surf with wondrous hues.</p>

<p>In the daytime occasional gleams of light
from the gliding water can be seen through the
small openings in the labyrinths of undergrowth
and between the tall tree trunks that crowd the
shadowy defile. At night there are tremulous reflections
of the moon among the thick foliage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
Strange ghostly beams touch the boles of the
solemn pines and sycamores and filter into the
sombre recesses.</p>

<p>The dramas of human life leave romance behind
them. Its halo hovers over these darkened
woods, for it was here that the beautiful Indian
girl, Omemee, was brought by her dusky Pottawattomie
lover, in the moon of falling leaves, and
it was here that the threads of their fate were
woven nearly a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Red Owl first saw her among the wild blackberry
bushes near the village of her people. She
had responded to his entreaties with shy glances,
and after many visits and much negotiation, her
father, a wrinkled old chief, had consented
to their union. Omemee’s savage charms had
brought many suitors to her father’s wigwam.
Her graceful willowy figure, long raven hair,
musical voice, dark luminous eyes and gentle
ways had made her a favorite of her village. She
was called the dove in the language of her tribe.
There was sorrow when she went away.</p>

<p>Red Owl’s prowess as a hunter, his skill in the
rude athletic sports of the village, displayed on
his frequent visits during the wooing, had won
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the admiration of the old warrior. Among the
many bundles of valuable pelts that were borne
along the Great Sauk Trail to the traders’ posts,
the largest were usually those of Red Owl. The
fire-water of the white man did not lure him to
disaster as it did many of his red brothers. He
always transacted his business quickly and returned
from the posts with the ammunition, traps
and other supplies for which he had exchanged his
furs.</p>

<p>For a year he quietly accumulated a secret
hoard of selected skins, which he laid before the
door of the fond father as the marriage offering.
The lovers disappeared on the trail that was to
lead them to their home. For five days they
travelled through the dunes and primeval forests.
They came down the trail that crossed French
Creek, climbed out of the ravine, and entered the
village of Red Owl’s people. The wigwams were
scattered along the stretch of higher ground
among the trees. Omemee was cordially welcomed
and soon grew accustomed to her new
environment.</p>

<p>For many years the young men of the tribe had
trapped muskrats, beaver and mink along the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
creek and in the swamps beyond its headwaters.
Small furred animals were abundant for many
miles around, and, during the fur season, the
trappers were dispersed over a wide extent of
territory.</p>

<p>When “Peg Leg” Carr came into the dune
country the only human trails he found were
those of the red men. He came alone and built
a cabin on the creek not far from the Indian Village.
Peg Leg may have still cherished a secret
longing for human society which he was not willing
to admit, even to himself. He had abandoned
his last habitat for the ostensible reason that
“thar was too many people ’round.” He came
from about a hundred miles back on the Sauk
Trail. After a family disagreement he had left
his wife and two sons to their own devices in the
wilderness, and was not heard of for nearly ten
years. He suddenly appeared one morning, stumping
along the trail, with his left knee fitted to the
top of a hickory support. The lower part of the
leg was gone, and he explained its absence by
declaring that it had been “bit off.” The time-worn
pleasantry seemed to amuse him, and no
amount of coaxing would elicit further details.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
There was a deep ugly scar in the left side of his
neck. His vocal chords had been injured and he
could talk only in hoarse whispers. He said that
his throat had been “gouged out.” Somebody or
something had nearly wrecked Peg Leg physically,
but the story, whatever it was, remained locked
in his bosom. He admitted that he had “been
to sea,” but beyond that no facts were obtainable.</p>

<p>After a brief sojourn at his old home he shouldered
his pack and started west. When he arrived
at French Creek he spent several days in looking
the country over before deciding on the location
of his cabin. He was a good-natured old fellow
and the Indians did not particularly resent his
intrusion, even when he began to set a line of
traps along the creek. The small animals were
so numerous that one trapper more or less made
little difference, and he got on very well with his
red neighbors. They rather pitied his infirmities
and were disposed to make allowances. He was
over seventy and apparently harmless.</p>

<p>When the old man had accumulated a small
stock of pelts it was his custom to carry them to
a trading post located about forty miles back on
the trail and exchange them for supplies for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
simple housekeeping and other necessities. These
trips often consumed ten days, as his loads were
heavy and he was compelled to travel slowly.
On his return, when he came to the rude log
bridge over which the trail crossed the creek in
the ravine, he would sometimes wearily lay his
pack down and pound on the timbers with his
hickory stump as a signal to those above. He
was unable to reach them with his impaired voice.
Somebody in the wigwams usually heard him and
came down to help the exhausted old trapper
carry his burden up the steep incline. After resting
awhile he would trudge on to his cabin.</p>

<p>A few years after the advent of Peg Leg a troop
of soldiers arrived and built a fort. For strategic
reasons the commander of the government post
at Detroit decided to keep a small garrison at the
end of the lake. A spot was cleared on the bluff
and two small brass cannon were mounted in the
block-house inside the log stockade. The tops
of the surrounding trees were cut away so that
the guns would command the trail from where it
entered the north side of the ravine to the point
at which it disappeared around a low hill south
of the fort.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>The French Creek Trail was a branch of the
Great Sauk Trail, which was the main thoroughfare
from the Detroit post to the mouth of Chicago
river. It was joined near the headwaters of
the St. Joseph and Kankakee rivers, in what is
now northeastern Indiana, by another trail that
followed the north banks of the Kankakee from
the Illinois country. The sinuous routes had been
used from time immemorable. They were the established
highways of the red men and the arteries
of their simple commerce. Thousands of moccasined
feet traversed them on peaceful errands, and
grim war parties sometimes moved swiftly along
the numberless forest paths that connected with
the main trails. There was a net-work of these
all through the Indian country. Trees twisted
and bent in a peculiar way, which we now often see
in the woods, were landmarks left by the makers of
various small trails that were travelled infrequently.</p>

<p>Soon after the fort was built at French Creek,
Pierre Chenault came and established a trading
post near the village. He was followed by a number
of settlers who built log houses along the edge
of the bluff. The red man’s fatherland was invaded.
The civilization of the white man&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the lack of it&mdash;had come, with its attending evils
of strong waters and organized rapacity. The
waves of an alien race, with strange tongues and
new weapons of steel, had broken over him. His
means of subsistence dwindled. His heritage was
passing to the sway of the despoiler.</p>

<p>The Indians loitered around Pierre Chenault’s
trading post, bartered their few valuables for
fire-water, and neglected the pursuits that had
made them happy and prosperous. Chenault was
a half-breed. His father belonged to that hardy
race of French-Canadian voyageurs who had
broken the paths of the wilderness in the north
country, and penetrated the fastnesses of the territory
of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi. His
mother was an Ojibwa on the south shore of
Lake Superior. He was about forty, with a lean
and hardened frame. His straight black hair was
beginning to be streaked with gray, and fell to
his shoulders. Piercing eyes looked out from
under the heavy brows with an expression of low
cunning, and his face carried the stamp of villainy.
He was a mongrel, and in his case the mixture
was a failure. He inherited the evil traits of both
races and none of the virtues of either.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>The creek was now practically abandoned as a
trapping ground by the Indians. With the exception
of Red Owl and Peg Leg, who divided the few
miles of the stream, the trappers had sought other
regions that were less disturbed. The dwellers in
the wigwams contemplated a general removal to
a more congenial habitat. Their neighbors were
getting too numerous for comfort, and their ways
of life were meeting with too much interference.
They did not object to Peg Leg, but he was all of
their white brothers that they felt they needed.</p>

<p>As the fur grew scarcer Red Owl rather resented
the rivalry of the old man’s interests, and occasionally
appropriated an otter or mink, when he
passed Peg Leg’s traps, and had found nothing in
his own. He probably lulled his conscience with
the idea that the animals naturally belonged to
the Indians, and that Peg Leg’s privileges were
a form of charity that need not be extended to the
point of his own self-denial.</p>

<p>Many times the half-breed had looked longingly
on the quiet-eyed Omemee when she came
to his post. He coveted Red Owl’s savage jewel.
Wickedness fermented in his depraved mind, but he
was too wise to make advances. He knew of Red
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Owl’s surreptitious visits to Peg Leg’s traps and
laid his plans with far-seeing craft. One still
February morning he saw him go into the ravine
and start up the creek on the ice. He seized his
rifle and crept through the thick timber and
undergrowth, away from the creek, paralleling the
course taken by the unsuspecting Indian. After
going a mile or so Red Owl stopped near the projecting
roots of a large elm. One of Peg Leg’s
traps was there and his rival was soon engaged in
killing and extracting a mink from the steel jaws
of the trap. The half-breed stole up to within a
hundred yards. A report rang in the crisp air
and a bullet crashed into the back of the Indian’s
head. The murderer left no trail near the frozen
creek. He made a wide detour, returned to his
post, after hiding his rifle in the snow, and awaited
results.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later Peg Leg hobbled along
the white water course to inspect his traps. He
followed Red Owl’s trail and came upon the still
form lying in the blood-stained snow on the ice.
He speculated for some time over the mystery
and went to the settlement to report what he had
found.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>The broken-hearted Omemee went with those
who departed for the scene of the tragedy. No
trail was visible except those of Red Owl and Peg
Leg. The old man’s tracks were easily recognized.
His denial of any guilty knowledge of the killing
was met by silence and dark looks. Circumstantial
evidence was against him. The motive was
obvious and the story was on the snow. The partial
justice of the retribution that had mysteriously
fallen upon the thief did not lessen the
innocent old trapper’s sorrow and fear, for he
knew that justice, age, or infirmity would be no
bar to Indian revenge. He would never have
killed Red Owl for interfering with his traps. A
high wind and a snow storm came up in the afternoon
that effectually baffled any further investigation.
The despondent old man kept the seclusion
of his cabin and brooded over his trouble for several
weeks.</p>

<p>Red Owl was laid away after the customs of his
people. Omemee departed into the wilderness to
mourn for her dead. After many days she returned
with the light in her eyes that gleams from those of
the she-panther when her young have been killed
before her&mdash;a light that an enemy sees but once.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>In the spring Peg Leg left with his pack of
winter pelts. He had once been cheated by Chenault
and preferred to do his trading where he had
gone before the half-breed came. His journey
consumed nearly two weeks. One evening at dusk
he laboriously picked his way down the steep
path into the ravine, laid his load of supplies on
the rude bridge, and then signalled for help by
pounding the bridge timbers with his hickory
stump. He was worn out and could not carry
his burden up the steep incline alone.</p>

<p>Like a snake from its covert, a beautiful wild
thing darted from the deep shadows of the pines.
The moccasined feet made no sound on the logs.
There was a gleam of steel, a lightning-like
movement, and Omemee glided on out of the
ravine into the gathering gloom. The silence was
broken by a heavy splash below the side of the
bridge, and when they found poor old Peg Leg
the hilt of a knife protruded from between his
shoulders.</p>

<p>There was a hidden observer of the tragedy.
Pierre Chenault had watched long and anxiously
for the stroke of Omemee’s revenge. The white
man’s law now gave him a coveted advantage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
He broke cover and pursued the fast retreating
figure. He would offer to conduct her to a place
of safety, protect her and declare his love.</p>

<p>Omemee ran with the speed of a deer in the
direction of the home of her childhood. She fled
out over the dunes to the shore of the lake. For
miles along the wild wave-washed coast the two
dim figures sped in the darkness. Omemee finally
dropped from exhaustion. The half-breed carried
her in his arms to the foot of the bluff where he
built a small fire behind a mass of drift-wood,
and sat beside her until the gray of the morning
came over the sand-hills. They were now about
twelve miles from the settlement. They walked
along the beach together for several hours and
turned into the dunes.</p>

<p>After the April rains tender leaves unfolded in
the trees around the bark wigwam where Omemee
was born. The old chief had died two years before,
but a faint wreath of smoke ascended softly
to the overhanging branches. Fastened above the
door was a grisly and uncanny thing that moved
fitfully to and fro when the winds blew from the
lake. It was the scalp of Pierre Chenault.</p>

<p>With the failure to obtain a government appropriation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
for a harbor at City West, the name of
the new settlement, the embryo town vanished
utterly and became a dream of the past. Its ambitions
and crushed hopes are entombed in obscure
history. No vestiges of its buildings remain.
There are traces of a crude mill race near the place
where the now obliterated trail crossed the creek.
Around the site of the old fort the trees, whose
tops were cut away to clear the range for the six-pounders,
have covered their wounds with new
limbs that have grown from the mutilated trunks.</p>

<p>Near the roots of a gnarled oak at a bend in the
stream Peg Leg’s dust has mingled with the black
loam, where his spirit may be lulled by the passing
waters. When we seem to hear the tapping
of the woodpecker on a hidden hollow tree in the
depths of the dark ravine, it may be the echoes
through the mists of the years of the strokes of
the poor old trapper on the timbers of the bridge.</p>

<p>The red man has gone. The currents of human
passion that rose and fell along the banks of the
little stream have passed into silence. The bistre-colored
waters still flow out on the wide expanse
of sand and spread their web of romance in the
moon-light.

THE MOON IN THE MARSH</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> is a hazy mist on the horizon
where the red rim of the October sun
left the sky-line. The twilight of Indian
Summer is stealing over the marsh. There is a
hush of vibrant voices and a muffled movement
of tiny life in the darkened places. Sorrow rests
upon the world, for the time of the requiem of
the leaves has come. The red arrows are abroad;
a flush of crimson is creeping through the forest.
An elusive fragrance of fruition is in the air, and
a drowsy languor droops the stems and branches.</p>

<p>Royal robes rustle faintly on the hills and in
the shadows of the woods. From among the living
trees a mighty presence has vanished. A
queen who came in green has departed as a nun
in gray, and the color fairies have entered the
bereaved realm with offerings of red and gold.</p>

<p>A vague unrest troubles the trembling aspens
and the little sassafras trees that flock like timid
children beyond the sturdy sycamores. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
gnarled oaks mutely await the winds of winter on
their castanets of cold dead leaves&mdash;music of our
Mother Earth to which we all must listen until
our slumber hour comes.</p>

<p>Through darkening masses of tangled thickets,
and over bogs concealed by matted grasses, some
soggy and decayed logs, covered with moss and
slime, lead out over the wet margin of the tarn
to the edge of the clear water. A startled bittern
rises clumsily out of the rushes. A pair of wild
ducks tower out and glide away over the tree-tops.
There are stifled rustlings in the ferns and
sedges, and little wings are fluttering furtively
among unseen branches. There is a soft splash
near the edge of the woods. From out the shadow
the curling wake of a muskrat stretches across
an open space. A mottled water-snake drops
stealthily into a wet labyrinth&mdash;the muffled movements
cease&mdash;and muted echoes of vesper choirs
sweeten the solitude that broods over the tarn.</p>

<p>After a period of silence another whir of pinions
overhead heralds the return of the ducks.
They circle swiftly and invisibly in the deep
shadows&mdash;their silhouettes dart across the sky
openings, and, with a loud swish, they strike the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
water and settle comfortably for the night behind
some weedy bogs close to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>In the gathering gloom tiny beams creep into
the depths of the water. One by one the starry
host begins to twinkle in the inverted canopy of
the heavens. The full-orbed silver moon rides
into the sky through the delicate lacery of the
trees with a flood of soft light. Another disk
sinks majestically into the abyss.</p>

<p>The asterisms of the astronomer are in the firmament
above, rolling in mighty cycles to the
ordered destinies of the spheres, but the stars of
Arcady are in the quiet pools, the placid bosoms
of gently flowing rivers, and far out in seas that
are beyond our ken. They sparkle in the smooth
curves of heavy swells on distant deeps, and shine
far below coral worlds in ocean depths. These
stars are measureless. They gleam in awful profundities
and illumine a world of dreams. We
may look down to them from the windows of a
fair castle in which a noble spirit dwells, but
beyond its walls we may not go. There are travellers
in that dimly lighted vault, for dark wings
blur the points of pallid radiance in swift and
silent flight. Eternity is not there, for its constellations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
will tremble and vanish with a passing
zephyr on the surface of the pool.</p>

<p>A white web of mist gathers on the water. A
phosphorescent trunk in the distance glows with
ghostly light. The fluffy movement of the wings
of a small owl is visible against a patch of sky,
and a moment later the dusky form whisks by in
the gloom. Agile bats wheel and plunge noiselessly
in pursuit of invisible prey. A few bulrushes
in a near-by clump are slightly disturbed.
The night life has begun to move in the slough,
for it is nature’s law that it must kill to live.</p>

<p>The veil of mist thickens&mdash;the stars in the
depths disappear&mdash;the moon’s reflection becomes
a nebula of pale effulgence, and is finally lost in
vaporous obscurity. Like the soft fabric of forgetfulness
that time weaves over sorrow, the mist
envelopes the tarn. Like wraiths of dead years,
filmy wreaths trail tenderly and delicately through
the solemn woods. The purple darkness has become
gray. A clammy wetness clings to the tall
grasses. Beads of crystal on their bending points
mirror feeble beams of light, and the heaviness of
humidity is upon the boughs and fallen leaves.</p>

<p>The moods of Nature are manifold in expression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
and power. In her infinite alchemy she reflects a
different ray into every facet of the human soul.
She echoes its exaltation, has sweet unguents for
its weariness, and leads it upon lofty paths of
promise when hope has died. The music of her
strings brings forth hidden melodies, and it is
with her that we must go if we would reach the
heights.</p>

<p>The dark morass becomes a dreamland. Through
it stately legions go. Ethereal aisles wind through
the trees. Cloudy walls rise along its borders, and
beyond them are kingdoms in elf-land where fancy
may spin fabrics of gossamer and build mansions
remote from earthly being.</p>

<p>There is a life of the soul as well as of the body.
We may ponder as to its immortality, but undeniably
it is in the present, if not in a state to come.
Hope grasps at a shadowy vision of the future
that dissolves at our touch. Reason gives only
the substance of the present, elusive though it be.
We live in a world of illusion, where seeming realities
may be but phantoms. We wander in a maze
of speculative thought. The paths are intricate
and only lead to narrow cells. The Forest Gods
that dwell in the high and hidden places speak a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
language that is without words. The fallen leaf
is as eloquent as established dogma or voice of
hoary seer. In our own hearts must we find our
shrines, for the obscurity beyond the borderland
of philosophy is as deep as the mould below the
leaves. The multitudes that have come upon the
earth and vanished have left no clue.</p>

<p>The key lies at the bottom of the tarn, and the
story is in the marsh.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">After</span> an industrious day with my sketch
book among the dunes, I walked over to
the lake shore and looked up the beach
toward Sipes’s shanty. In the gathering twilight
a faint gleam came through the small window.
Not having seen my old friend for nearly a year,
I decided to pay him a visit. My acquaintance
with him had brought me many happy hours as
I listened to his reminiscences, some of which are
recorded in former stories.</p>

<p>He had been a salt water sailor, and, with his
shipmate Bill Saunders, had met with many thrilling
adventures. He had finally drifted to the
sand-hills, where he had found a quiet refuge
after a stormy life. Fishing and hunting small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
game yielded him a scanty but comparatively
happy livelihood. He was a queer, bewhiskered
little man, somewhere in the seventies, with many
idiosyncrasies, a fund of unconscious humor, much
profanity, a great deal of homely philosophy, and
with many ideas that were peculiarly his own.</p>

<p>He wore what he called a “hatch” over the
place which his right eye formerly occupied, and
explained the absence of the eye by telling me
that it had been blown out in a gale somewhere off
the coast of Japan. He said that “it was glass
anyway” and he “never thought much of it.”
Saunders figured more or less in all of his stories
of the sea.</p>

<p>On approaching the nondescript driftwood structure,
I heard a stentorian voice, the tones of which
the little shanty was too frail to confine, and which
seemed to be pitched for the solemn pines that
fringed the brink of the dark ravine beyond.</p>

<p>“Now all ye hell-destined sinners that are in
this holy edifice, listen to me! Ye who are steeped
in sin shall frizzle in the fires o’ damnation. The
seethin’ cauldrons yawn. Ye have deserved the
fiery pit an’ yer already sentenced to it. Hell is
gaping fer this whole outfit. The flames gather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
an’ flash. The fury o’ the wrath to come is almost
’ere. Yer souls are damned an’ you may all be in
hell ’fore tomorrer mornin’. The red clouds o’
comin’ vengeance are over yer miserable heads.
You’ll be enveloped in fiery floods fer all eternity&mdash;fer
millions of ages will ye sizzle. Ye hang by
a slender thread. The flames may singe it any
minute an’ in ye go. Ye have reason to wonder
that yer not already in hell! Yer accursed bodies
shall be laid on live coals, an’ with red-hot pitch-forks
shall ye be sorted into writhin’ piles an’
hurled into bottomless pits of endless torment.
I’m the scourge o’ the Almighty. I’m Ezekiel-seven-nine.
This is yer last chance to quit, an’
you’ve got to git in line, an’ do it quick if ye want
to keep from bein’ soused in torrents o’ burnin’
brimstone, an’ have melted metal poured into yer
blasphemous throats!”</p>

<p>At this point the door partially opened and a
furtive figure slipped out. “Let all them that has
hard hearts an’ soft heads git out!” roared the
voice. The figure moved swiftly toward me and
I recognized Sipes.</p>

<p>“Gosh! Is that you? You keep away from
that place,” he sputtered, as he came up.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>“What seems to be the trouble?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It’s Holy Zeke an’ he’s cussin’ the bunch. It
looks like we’d all have a gloomy finish. He was
up ’ere this mornin’ an’ ast me if ’e could ’ave a
reevival in my place tonight. He’s ’ad pretty
much ev’rythin’ else that was loose ’round ’ere,
an’ like a damn fool I told ’im O. K., an’ this is
wot I git. I thought it was sump’n else. You
c’n go an’ listen to ’is roar if you want to, but I
got some business to ’tend to ’bout ten miles
from ’ere, an’ I wont be back ’till tomorrer, an’
w’en I come back it’ll be by water. I’m goin’ to
lay fer that ol’ skeet with my scatter gun, an’
he’ll think he’s got hot cinders under ’is skin w’en
I git to ’im. I’ll give ’im all the hell I can without
murderin’ ’im.” Sipes then disappeared into the
gloom, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>His “scatter gun” was a sinister weapon. It
had once been a smooth-bore army musket. The
barrel had been sawed off to within a foot of the
breach. It was kept loaded with about six ounces
of black powder, and, wadded on top of this, was
a handful of pellets which the old man had made
of flour dough, mixed with red pepper, and hardened
in the sun. He claimed that, at three rods,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
such a charge would go just under the skin. “It
wouldn’t kill nothin’, but it ’ud be hot stuff.”</p>

<p>I sat on a pile of driftwood for some time and
waited for the turmoil in the shanty to subside.
Finally the door opened and four more figures
emerged. I was glad to recognize my old friend
“Happy Cal,” whom I had not seen since his
mysterious departure from the sand-hills several
years ago, after his dispute with Sipes over some
tangled set-lines. Evidently the two old derelicts
had amicably adjusted their differences, and Cal
had rejoined the widely scattered colony. Another
old acquaintance, “Catfish John,” was also in the
party. After greetings were exchanged, John introduced
me to a short stocky man with gray
whiskers.</p>

<p>“Shake hands with Bill Saunders,” said he.</p>

<p>This I did with pleasure, as Sipes’s yarns of the
many exploits of this supposedly mythical individual
invested him with much interest.</p>

<p>“This ’ere’s Ezekiel-seven-nine,” continued
John, indicating the remaining member of the
quartette.</p>

<p>I offered “Ezekiel-seven-nine” my hand, but
it was ignored. He looked at me sternly. “Yer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
smokin’ a vile an’ filthy weed,” said he. “It defiles
yer soul an’ yer body. It’s an abomination
in the sight o’ the Lord. Yer unclean to my
touch.” With that he turned away.</p>

<p>I glanced at his hands and if anything could
be “unclean” to them its condition must be quite
serious. I quite agreed with him, but from a different
standpoint, that the cigar was “an abomination,”
and, after a few more doubtful whiffs,
I threw it away, as I had been tempted to do
several times after lighting it. Its purchase had
proved an error of judgment.</p>

<p>Zeke’s impressions of me were evidently not
very favorable. He walked away a short distance
and stopped. In the dim light I could see that
he was regarding us with disapproval. He took
no part in the conversation. He finally seated
himself on the sand and gazed moodily toward
the lake for some time, probably reflecting upon
the unutterable depravity of his present associates,
and calculating their proximity to eternal
fire.</p>

<p>“Holy Zeke,” as Sipes had called him, was
about six feet two. His clothes indicated that
they had been worn uninterruptedly for a long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
time. The mass of bushy red whiskers would
have offered a tempting refuge for wild mice, and
from under his shaggy brows the piercing eyes
glowed with fanatic light.</p>

<p>Calvinism had placed its dark and heavy seal
upon his soul, and the image of an angry and
pitiless Creator enthralled his mind&mdash;a God who
paves infernal regions with tender infants who
neglect theology, who marks the fall of a sparrow,
but sends war, pestilence and famine to annihilate
the meek and pure in heart.</p>

<p>The wonderful drama of the creation, and the
beautiful story of Omnipotent love carried no
message for him. Lakes of brimstone and fire
awaited all of earth’s blindly groping children who
failed to find the creed of the self-elect. Notwithstanding
the fact that the national governing
board of an orthodox church, with plenary powers,
convened a few years ago, officially abolished infant
damnation, and exonerated and redeemed all
infants, who up to that time had been subjected
to the fury of Divine wrath, Zeke’s doctrine was
unaltered. It glowed with undiminished fervor.
He was a restless exponent of a vicious and cruel
man-made dogma, which was as evil as the punishments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
it prescribed, and as futile as the rewards
it promised.</p>

<p>To me Holy Zeke was an incarnation. His
eyes and whiskers bespoke the flames of his theology,
and his personality was suggestive of its place
in modern thought. His battered plug hat was
also Calvinistic. It looked like hades. It was indescribable.
One edge of the rim had been scorched,
and a rent in the side of the crown suggested the
possibility of the escape of volcanic thought in
that direction. Like his theology, he had picturesque
quality.</p>

<p>If he had been a Mohammedan, his eyes would
have had the same gleam, and he would have
called the faithful to prayer from a minaret with
the same fierce fervor as that with which he conjured
up the eternal fires in Sipes’s shanty. Had
not Calvinism obsessed him, his type of mind
might have made him a murderous criminal and
outlaw, who, with submarines and poison gas,
would deny mercy to mankind, for there was no
quality of mercy in those cruel orbs. They were
the baleful eyes of the jungle, that coldly regard
the chances of the kill. In Holy Zeke’s case the
kill was the forcible snatching of the quarry from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
hell, not that he desired its salvation, but was
anxious to deprive the devil of it. He had no idea
of pointing a way to righteousness. There was no
spiritual interest in the individual to be rescued.
He was the devil’s implacable enemy, and it was
purely a matter of successful attack upon the
property of his foe. Predestination or preordination
did not bother him. He made no distinctions.
There was no escape for any human being
whose belief differed from his; even the slightest
variation from his infallible creed meant the
bottomless pit.</p>

<p>Zeke had one redeeming quality. He was not a
mercenary. No board of trustees paid him the
wages of hypocrisy. He did not arch his brows
and fingers and deliver carefully prepared eloquent
addresses to the Creator, designed more for the
ears of his listeners than for the throne above.
He did not beseech the Almighty for private
favors, or for money to pay a church debt. He
regarded himself as a messenger of wrath, and
considered that he was authorized to go forth and
smite and curse anything and everything within
his radius of action. This radius was restricted
to the old derelicts who lived in the little driftwood
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
shanties along the beach and among the
sand-hills. There were but few of them, but the
limited scope of Zeke’s labors enabled him to concentrate
his power instead of diffusing and losing
it in larger fields.</p>

<p>Zeke soon left our little party and followed a
path up into the ravine. After his departure we
built a fire of driftwood, sat around it on the sand,
and discussed the “scourge.”</p>

<p>“I hate to see anythin’ that looks like a fire,
after wot we’ve been up ag’inst tonight,” remarked
Cal, as he threw on some more sticks, “but as ’e
ain’t ’ere to chuck us in, I guess we’ll be safe if we
don’t put on too much wood. Where d’ye s’pose
’e gits all that dope? I had a Bible once’t, but I
didn’t see nothin’ like that in it. There was a
place in it where some fellers got throwed in a
fiery furnace an’ nothin’ happened to ’em at all,
an’ there was another place where it said that the
wicked ’ud have their part in hell fire, but I
didn’t read all o’ the book an’ mebbe there’s a
lot o’ hot stuff in it I missed. W’en did you fust
see that ol’ cuss, John?”</p>

<p>Catfish John contemplated the fire for a while,
shifted his quid of “natural leaf,” and relighted his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
pipe. He always said that he “couldn’t git no enjoyment
out o’ tobacco without usin’ it both ways.”</p>

<p>“He come ’long by my place one day ’bout
three years ago,” said the old man. “It was Sunday
an’ ’e stopped an’ read some verses out of
’is Bible while I was workin’ on my boat. He said
the Lord rested on the seventh day, an’ I’d go to
hell if I didn’t stop work on the Sabbath. I told
’im that my boat would go to hell if I didn’t fix
it, an’ they wasn’t no other day to do it. Then
’e gave me wot ’e called ‘tracks’ fer me to read
an’ went on. The Almighty’s got some funny
fellers workin’ fer ’im. This one’s got hell on the
brain an’ ’e ought to stay out in the lake where it’s
cool. Ev’ry little while ’e comes ’round an’ talks
’bout loaves an’ fishes, an’ sometimes I give ’im
a fish, w’en I have a lot of ’em. He does the loaf
part ’imself, fer sometimes ’e sticks ’round fer an
hour or two. Then ’e tells me some more ’bout
hell an’ goes off some’r’s, prob’ly to cook ’is fish.”</p>

<p>“Sipes must ’a’ come back. Let’s go over
there,” suggested Saunders, as he called our attention
to the glimmer of a light in the shanty.</p>

<p>As we approached the place the light was extinguished,
and a voice called out, “Who’s there?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>After the identity of the party had been established,
and the assurance given that Holy Zeke
was not in it, the light reappeared and we were
hospitably received.</p>

<p>“Wot did you fellers do with that hell-fire
cuss?” demanded Sipes when we were all seated
in the shanty. “Look wot’s ’ere!” and he picked
up a small, greasy hymn book which the orator
had forgotten in the excitement. Sipes handed
me the book. I opened it at random and read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Not all the blood of beasts, on Jewish altars slain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Can give the guilty conscience peace, or wash away the stain.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Gimme that!” yelled Sipes, and I heard the
little volume strike the sand somewhere out in
the dark near the water. “Wot d’ye s’pose I got
this place fer if it ain’t to have peace an’ quiet
’ere, an’ wot’s this red-headed devil comin’ ’round
’ere fer an’ fussin’ me all up tell’n’ me where I’m
goin’ w’en I die, w’en I don’t give a whoop where
I go when I die. That feller’s bunk an’ don’t you
fergit it, an’ ’e’s worse’n that, fer look ’ere wot I
found in that basket where I had about two
pounds o’ salt pork!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>He produced a piece of soiled and crumpled
paper, on which were scrawled the following quotations:
“Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and
their carcass shall ye not touch. They are unclean
to you” (Leviticus 11:8). “Curséd shall be
thy basket and thy store” (Deuteronomy 28:17).</p>

<p>“It’s all right fer ’im to cuss my basket if ’e
wants to, but I ain’t got no store. I’ll bet ’e
frisked that hunk o’ pork an’ chucked in them
texts ’fore you fellers got ’ere an’ I got in off’n
the lake. It was in ’is big coat pocket all the
time he was makin’ that hot spiel, an’ that’s w’y
’e didn’t ’ave no room fer ’is hymn book. He’s
swiped my food an’ I can’t fry them texts, an’
you fellers are all in on it fer I was goin’ to cook
the pork an’ we’d all have sump’n to eat. He
cert’nly spread hell ’round ’ere thick tonight.
Some day he’ll be yellin’ fer ice all right. Who
are them Leviticus an’ Deuteronomy fellers anyhow?
They ain’t no friends o’ mine!</p>

<p>“I’m weary o’ that name o’ Zekiel-seven-nine
he’s carryin’ ’round. ’E ought to have an eight
spot in it, an’ with a six an’ a ten ’e’d ’ave a
straight an’ it ’ud take a flush er a full house to
beat ’im. I bet ’e’s a poker sharp, an’ ’e’s hidin’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
from sump’n over ’ere, an’ ’e ain’t the fust one
that’s done it. I seen ’im stewed once’t an’ ’e
had a lovely still. He’d oozed in the juice over to
the county seat an’ come over ’ere an’ felt bad
about it in my shanty. He come up to the window
w’en I was fixin’ my pipe an yelled, ‘Bow
ye not down ’afore idols!’ I went out an’ hustled
’im in out o’ the wet. It was rainin’ pretty bad
an’ ’e was soaked, but ’e said ’e didn’t care so
long’s none of it didn’t git in ’is stummick. I
dassent light a match near ’is breath.</p>

<p>“I had ’im ’ere two days, an’ ’e said he’d took
sump’n by mistake, an’ ’e had. I had to keep
givin’ ’im more air all the time. He drunk enough
water the next mornin’ to put out a big fire an’ I
guess ’e had one in ’im all right. After that ’e
ast me if I had any whiskey, an’ w’en I told ’im
I didn’t, ’e said ’e was glad of it, fer it was devil’s
lure. He’d ’a’ stowed it if he’d got to it. I did
’ave a little an’ I guess now’s a good time to git
it out, an’ I hope I don’t find no texts stuck in
the jug. We all need bracin’ up, so ’ere goes!
That feller’s a blankety-blankety-blank&mdash;blank-blank,
an’ besides that ’e’s got other faults!”</p>

<p>It seems a pity to have to expurgate Sipes’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
original and ornate profanity from his discourses,
but common decency requires it. The old man
left the shanty with a lantern and shovel. A few
minutes later we saw his light at the edge of the
lake where he was washing the sand from the outside
of his jug. Evidently it had been buried
treasure.</p>

<p>“I’ve et an’ drunk so much sand since I been
livin’ ’ere on this beach that my throat’s all wore
out an’ full o’ little holes, an’ I ain’t goin’ to
swaller no more’n I c’n help after this,” he remarked,
as he came in and hung the lantern on
its hook in the ceiling; “now you fellers drink
hearty.”</p>

<p>At this juncture a wailing sepulchral voice,
loud and deep, came out of the darkness in the
distance.</p>

<p>“Beware! Beware! Beware! In the earth
have ye found damnation!”</p>

<p>“There ’e is!” yelled Sipes, as he leaped across
the floor for his scatter-gun. He ran out with it
and was gone for some time. He returned with
an expression of disgust on his weather-beaten
face. “I’ll wing that cuss some night ’fore the
snow falls,” he remarked, as he resumed his seat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
“We’d better soak up all this booze tonight fer it
won’t be safe in any o’ the ground ’round ’ere any
more. Gosh! but this is a fine country to live in!”</p>

<p>The party broke up quite late. Happy Cal had
imbibed rather freely. Catfish John had been
more temperate, and thought he had “better go
’long with Cal,” and it seemed better that he
should. As they went away I could hear Cal
entertaining John with snatches of some old air
about “wine, women, an’ song.” They stopped
a while at the margin of the lake, where the wet
sand made the walking better, and Cal affectionately
assured John of his eternal devotion. They
then disappeared.</p>

<p>I bade Sipes and his old shipmate good-night,
and left them alone with the demon in the jug.
There was very little chance of any of it ever
falling into the hands of “the scourge,” who was
evidently lurking in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The glory of the full moon over the lake caused
Sipes to remark that “ev’rythin’s full tonight,”
as he followed me out to bid me another good-by.
After I left I could hear noisy vocalism in the
shanty. The words, which were sung over and
over, were:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Comrades, comrades, ever since we was boys,&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Sharing each other’s sorrows, sharing each other’s joys.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After each repetition there would be boisterous,
rhythmic pounding of heavy boots on the wooden
floor.</p>

<p>While the song was in many keys, and was
technically open to much criticism, it was evidently
sincere. The old shipmates were happy,
and, after all, besides happiness, how much is
there in the world really worth striving for?</p>

<p>I walked along the beach for a couple of miles
to my temporary quarters in the dunes, and the
stirring events of the evening furnished much
food for reflection. I was interested in the advent
of Bill Saunders, concerning whom I had heard
so much from Sipes. Bill was a good deal of a
mystery. He had “showed up” a few days before
in response to a letter which Sipes told me
he had “put in <i>pust</i>office fer ’im.” He may at
some time have lived on the “unknown island in
the South Pacific” that Sipes told me about,
where he and Bill had been wrecked, and Bill had
“married into the royal family several times,”
but evidently he had deserted his black and tan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
household. For at least two years he had been
living over on the river. Sipes explained that he
stayed there “so as to be unbeknown.” For some
reason which I did not learn, he and Sipes considered
it advisable for him to “keep dark” for
a while. The trouble, whatever it was, had evidently
blown over, and Bill had returned to the
sand-hills.</p>

<p>There was a rudely painted sign on the shanty
a few days later, which read:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" id="i092" src="images/i092.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">$IPE$ &amp; $AUNDER$&mdash;FRE$H FI$H</p></div>

<p>“It might ’a’ been Saunders &amp; Sipes,” said
the old man to me, confidentially, “but I think
Sipes &amp; Saunders sounds more dignified like, don’t
you? We got ‘fresh fish’ on the sign so’s people
won’t git ’em mixed up with the kind o’ fish John
peddles. Them fish are fresh w’en John gits ’em
’ere, but after ’e’s ’ad ’em ’round a while there’s
invisible bein’s gits into ’em out o’ the air, an’
you c’n smell ’em a mile. W’en they git to be
candydates fer ’is smoke-house their ol’ friends
wouldn’t know ’em, an’ I put them up an’ down
lines in them S’s in them names so’s to make the
sign look like cash money.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>Several days later I discovered that my tent
had been visited during my absence. Outside,
pinned to the flap, was a piece of paper on which
was written:</p>

<p>“All ye who smoke or chew the filthy weed
shall be damned.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>The breath of hell, an angry breath,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Supplies and fans the fire,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>When smokers taste the second death</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>And shriek and howl, but can’t expire.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inside, on the cot, were several tracts containing
extracts from sermons on hell by an old ranter
of early New England days, setting forth the
practical impossibility of anybody ever escaping it.</p>

<p>I examined the literature with interest and
amusement. Some of the more virulent paragraphs
were marked for my benefit.</p>

<p>I looked out over the landscape, with its glorious
autumn coloring, to the expanse of turquoise
waters beyond, and wondered if, above the fleecy
clouds and the infinite blue of the heavens, there
was an Omnipotent monstrosity Who gloried in
the torture of what He created, and brought forth
life that He might wreak vengeance upon it.
Ignorance, fear, and superstition have led men into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
strange paths. It may be that our philosophy
will finally lead us back to the beginning, and
teach us that we are humble, wondering children
who do not understand, and that there is a border
land beyond which we may not go.</p>

<p>I met the firm of Sipes &amp; Saunders on the beach
one morning, on their way to Catfish John’s
place, which was about four miles from their
shanty. John’s abode was on a low bluff, and on
the beach near it, about a hundred feet from the
lake, was the little structure in which he smoked
what Sipes called “them much-deceased fish”
which he had failed to sell. His peddling trips
were made through the back country with a queer
little wagon and a rheumatic horse, that bore the
name of “Napoleon” with his other troubles.
Some of the fish were from his own nets, but most
of his supplies were obtained from Sipes on a
consignment basis.</p>

<p>At the earnest solicitation of the old mariners,
I turned back and went with them to call on
John. Sipes said that I “had better come along
fer there’s goin’ to be sump’n doin’.”</p>

<p>We found the old man out on the sand repairing
his gill-nets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<p>“Wot ’ave I done that I should be descended
on like this?” he asked jocularly, as we came up.
“You fellers must be lookin’ fer trouble, fer Zeke’s
comin’ ’ere this mornin’ fer a fish that I told ’im
’e could ’ave if I got any.</p>

<p>“I figgered it all out,” said Sipes, “cause Bill
heard you tell ’im you was goin’ to lift the nets
Sunday, an’ I seen you out’n the lake with the
spotter, an’ as Bill an’ me’s got some business
with Zeke, we thought we’d drop ’round.”</p>

<p>Sipes’s “spotter” was an old spy glass, which
he declared “had been on salt water.” Through
a small hole in the side of his shanty he could
sweep the curving shore for several miles with
the rickety instrument.</p>

<p>I walked over to the smoke-house with the
party and inspected it with much interest. The
smoke supply came from a dilapidated old stove
on the sand from which a rusty pipe entered the
side of the structure. The smoke escaped slowly
through various cracks in the roof, which provided
a light draft for the fire.</p>

<p>“That smoke gits a lot of experience in this
place ’fore it goes out through them cracks,” remarked
Sipes, as he opened the door and peered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
inside. “I don’t blame it fer leavin’. Can ye
lock this door tight, John?”</p>

<p>I curiously awaited further developments.</p>

<p>It was not long before we saw Zeke plodding
toward us on the sand.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you fellers say nothin’. You jest
set ’round careless like, an’ let me do the talkin’,”
cautioned Sipes, as he filled his pipe. With an
expressive closing of his single eye, he turned to
me confidentially and said with a chuckle, “We’re
goin’ to fumigate Zeke.”</p>

<p>There was a look of quiet determination in his
face, and guile in his smile as he contemplated
the approaching visitor.</p>

<p>“Hello, Zeke!” he called out, as soon as that
frowsy individual was within hailing distance,
“wot’s the news from hell this fine mornin’?”</p>

<p>We smiled at Sipes’s sally. Zeke looked at us
solemnly, and in deep impressive tones replied:
“Verily, them that laughs at sin, laughs w’en
their Maker frowns, laughs with the sword o’
vengeance over their heads.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, Zeke, cut that out,” said Sipes,
“an’ let’s go in an’ see the big sturgeon wot John
got this mornin’. It’s ’ere in the smoke-house.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Sipes led the way to the door and opened it.
Zeke peeked in cautiously.</p>

<p>“It’s over in that big box with them other fish
near the wall,” said Sipes. Zeke stepped inside.
Sipes instantly closed the door and sprung the
padlock that secured it. He then ran around to
the stove and lighted the fuel with which it was
stuffed.</p>

<p>An angry roar came from the interior, as we
departed. After we reached the damp sand on
the shore, Sipes joyfully exclaimed, “Verily we’ll
now ’ave to git a new scourge, fer this one’s up
ag’inst damnation!”</p>

<p>While John had passively acquiesced in the proceedings,
I knew that he did not intend to allow
Sipes’s escapade to go too far, so I did not worry
about Zeke.</p>

<p>As we walked down the shore, Sipes and Bill
turned frequently to look at the softly ascending
wreaths from the roof with much glee.</p>

<p>“That coop’s never ’ad nothin’ wuss in it than
it’s got now,” declared Sipes. “That ol’ bunch
o’ whiskers ’as got wot’s comin’ to ’im this time,
an’ I wish I’d stuck John’s rubber boots in that
stove, but, honest, I fergot it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>We had gone quite a distance when I turned
and discerned a retreating form far beyond the
smoke-house close to the bluff. One side of the
structure was wrecked, and it was evident that
the “scourge” had broken through and escaped.
I said nothing, as I did not want to mar the
pleasure of the old shipmates. To them it was
“the end of a perfect day.”</p>

<p>A little further on I left them and turned into
the dunes. As they waved farewell, Sipes called
out cheerily, “You c’n travel anywheres ’round
’ere now without git’n’ burnt!”</p>

<p>Later, from far away over the sands, I could
faintly hear:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Shipmates, shipmates, ever since we was boys&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Sharing each other’s sorrows, sharing each other’s joys!</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One night I encased myself in storm-defying
raiment and went down to the shore to contemplate
a drama that was being enacted in the skies.</p>

<p>Swiftly moving battalions of stygian clouds
were illuminated by almost continuous flashes
of lightning. Heavy peals of thunder rolled
through the convoluted masses, and reverberated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
along the horizon. The wind-driven rain
came in thin sheets that mingled with the flying
spray from the waves that swept the beach. The
sublimity of the storm was soul stirring and
inspiring. I plodded for half a mile or so along
the surf-washed sand to the foot of a bluff on
which were a few old pines, to see the effect of
the gnarled branches against the lightning-charged
clouds.</p>

<p>A brilliant flash revealed a silhouetted figure
with gesticulating arms. It was Holy Zeke. His
battered plug was jammed down over the back
of his head, and his long coat tails were flapping
in the gale. The apparition was grotesque and
startling, but seemed naturally to take its place
in the wild pageant of the elements. It added
a note of human interest that seemed strangely
harmonious.</p>

<p>I did not wish to intrude on him, or allow him
to interfere with my enjoyment of the storm, but
passed near enough to hear his resonant voice
above the roar of the wind.</p>

<p>He was in his element. He had sought a height
from which he could behold the scourging of the
earth, and pour forth imprecations on imaginary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
multitudes of heretics and unbelievers. With fanatic
fervor he was calling down curses upon a world
of hopeless sin. Hatred of human kind was exhaled
from his poisoned soul amid the fury of the storm.</p>

<p>To his disordered imagination, any unusual
manifestation of nature’s forces was an expression
of Divine wrath. Condemnation was now
coming out of the black vault above him, and the
vengeance of an incensed Diety was being heralded
from on high. Unregenerate sinners and
rejectors of Zeke’s creed were in the hands of an
angry God. The scroll of earth’s infamy was
being unrolled out of the clouds. “The seventh
vial” was being poured out, and the hour of final
damnation was at hand.</p>

<p>In the armor of his infallible orthodoxy, like
Ajax, he stood unafraid before the lurid shafts.
Serene in his exclusive holiness he was immune
from the fiery pit and the shambles of the damned,
and gloried in the coming destruction of all those
unblessed with his faultless dogma.</p>

<p>The storm was increasing in violence, and I
had started to return. After going some distance
I turned for a final view of Zeke, and it was unexpectedly
dramatic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>There was a sudden dazzling glare, and a deafening
crash. A tall tree, not far from where he
stood, was shattered into fragments. The shock
was terrific. He was gone when a succeeding
flash lighted the scene. Fearing that the old
man might have met fatality, or at least have
been badly injured, I hurried back and climbed
the steep path that led to the top of the promontory
from the ravine beyond it. Careful search,
with the aid of an electric pocket light and the
lightning flashes, failed to reveal any traces of
the old fanatic, and it was safe to assume that he
had retreated in good order from surroundings
that he had reluctantly decided were untenable.</p>

<p>The bolt that struck the tree was charged with
an obvious moral that was probably lost on the
fugitive.</p>

<p>The old shipmates were much interested when
they heard the tale of the night’s adventure.</p>

<p>“That ol’ cuss’ll git his, sometime, good an’
plenty,” observed Sipes. “Sump’n took a pot
shot at Zeke an’ made a bad score. It would ’a’
helped some if the lightnin’ ’ad only got that ol’
hat o’ his. Prob’ly it’s been hit before. Zeke ’ad
better look out. He’s been talkin’ too much ’bout
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
them things. It’s too bad fer a nice tree like that
to git all busted up. No feller with a two-gallon
hat an’ red whiskers ever oughta buzz ’round in
a thunder storm.”</p>

<p>John was quite philosophical about Zeke.</p>

<p>“He ought to learn to stay in w’en it’s wet.
His kind o’ relig’n don’t mix with water, an’ some
night ’e’ll go out in a storm like that an’ ’e won’t
come back. He was ’round ’ere this mornin’
tell’n me ’bout the signs o’ the times an’ heav’nly
fires.</p>

<p>“Them ol’ fellers hadn’t ought to fuss so
much ’bout ’im. They come up ’ere the day
after they smoked ’im, an’ fixed my smoke-house
all up fer me. They said thar was too many
cracks ’round in it, an’ the boards ’round the sides
was all too thin. They got some heavy boards
an’ big nails an’ they done a good job. They said
they’d fixed it so it ’ud hold a grizzly b’ar if I
wanted to keep one, an’ I was glad they come up.</p>

<p>“When Zeke broke through ’e didn’t fergit ’is
fish. He took the biggest one thar was in the
box. When ’e went off ’e was yell’n sump’n ’bout
them that stoned an’ mocked the prophets, an’
sump’n ’bout a feller named Elijah, that was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
goin’ up in a big wind in a chair o’ fire, but I
didn’t hear all of it, fer ’e was excited. Zeke’s a
poor ol’ feller. It’s all right fer ’em to cuss ’im,
fer ’e gives it to ’em pretty hard w’en ’e gits
down thar, but that don’t do no harm. They
ain’t no nearer hell than they’d be without Zeke
tell’n ’em ’bout it all the time. He’s part o’ the
people what’s ’round us, an’ we ought to git ’long
with ’im. I’ll alw’ys give ’im a fish when ’e’s
hungry, even if ’e does think I’m goin’ to hell.”

THE LOVE AFFAIR OF HAPPY CAL
AND ELVIREY SMETTERS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">“Happy Cal”</span> had been a member of the
widely scattered colony of derelicts along
the wild coast for many years; in fact,
he was its beginning, for when he came through
the sand-hills and gathered the driftwood to build
his humble dwelling, there were no human neighbors.</p>

<p>The circling gulls, the crows, and the big blue
herons that stalked along the wave-washed beach
looked curiously at the intruder into their solitudes.
The blue-jays scolded boisterously, and
many pairs of concealed eyes peered at him slyly
from tangled masses of tree roots that lay denuded
upon the slopes of the wind-swept dunes.</p>

<p>Nature’s slow and orderly processes of generation
and decay were now to be disturbed by a
new element, for man, who changes, destroys, and
makes ugly the fair world he looks upon, had entered
these sanctuaries. The furred and feathered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
things instinctively resented the advent of the
despoiler. They heard strange noises as rusty
nails were pounded, and odd pieces of gray,
smooth wood were fashioned into the queer-looking
structure that obtruded itself among the undulations
of the sand.</p>

<p>Happy Cal was human wreckage. He had
been thrown upon this desolate shore by the cruel
forces of a social system which he was unable to
combat. They had cast him aside and he had
sought isolation. As he expressed it, “there was
too much goin’ on.”</p>

<p>Cal’s stories of his early life, and his final escape
from a heartless world, incited derisive comment
from his friend Sipes.</p>

<p>On still, cool days the smoke ascended softly
from Cal’s shanty, and my sketching was often
neglected for an hour or two with its interesting
occupant.</p>

<p>He sometimes prowled around through the country
back of the dunes at night, and the necessaries
for his rude housekeeping were collected gradually.
His age was difficult to guess; perhaps he
looked older than he was. His lustreless eyes,
weather-beaten face, grizzled unkempt beard, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
rough hands, carried the story of a struggle on
the raw edges of life.</p>

<p>While he said that he had “been up ag’inst it,”
he seemed now comparatively contented. His interests
were few, but they filled his days, and, as
he expressed it, he “didn’t need nothin’ to think
about nights.” Sipes claimed, however, that “Cal
done all ’s thinkin’ at night, if ’e done any, fer ’e
don’t never do none in the daytime.”</p>

<p>Sipes and Cal met occasionally. With the exception
of a few serious misunderstandings, which
were always eventually patched up, they got
along very well with each other. Sipes’s attitude,
while generally friendly, was not very charitable.
He was disposed to comment caustically upon the
many flaws he found in Cal, who, he believed,
was destined for a hot hereafter. It is only fair
to Cal to say that Sipes did not know of anybody
in the dune country who would not have a hot
hereafter, except his friend “Catfish John,” and
his old shipmate, Bill Saunders, who lived with
him, and with whom, in early life, he had sailed
many stormy seas. He transacted his fish business
with John, and was very fond of him. He
once remarked that, “Old John don’t never wash,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
an’ ’e smells pretty fishy, but you bet ’e treats
me all right, an’ wot’s the difference? I c’n always
stay to wind’ard if I want to.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Elvirey Smetters lived over in the back
country, on the road that led from the sleepy village
to the marshy strip, and through it over into
the dunes, where it was finally lost in the sand.
It was a township line road and was seldom used
for traffic. Travellers on it usually walked. The
house, which had once been painted white, with
green blinds, was rather shabby. Two tall evergreens
stood in the front yard. In the carefully
kept flower-beds along the fence the geraniums,
cockscombs, marigolds, and verbenas bloomed gorgeously.
They were constantly refreshed from
the wooden pump near the back door. A smooth
path led from the front gate, flanked with a luxurious
growth of myrtle.</p>

<p>I pulled the brown bell handle one morning
with a view of buying one of the young ducks
which were waddling and quacking about the
yard. I was going over to visit my old friend
Sipes and intended it as a present for his Sunday
dinner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smetters, whom I had often met, opened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the door. She wiped her face with her apron,
and was profuse with her apologies for the appearance
of everything. She explained at length the
various causes that had brought about the disorderly
conditions, which I must know would be
different if so and so, and so and so, and so
and so.</p>

<p>She was tall, muscular, of many angles, red-headed,
and freckled. The pupils of the piercing
eyes behind the brass-rimmed spectacles had a
reddish tinge, and her square, protruding chin suggested
anything but domestic docility. It was
such a chin that took Napoleon over the Alps,
and Cæsar into Gaul.</p>

<p>She had buried three husbands. They were
resting, as Sipes said, “fer the fust time in their
lives,” in the church-yard beyond the village,
where flowers from the little garden were often
laid upon the mounds.</p>

<p>A village gossip had said that Mrs. Smetters
would sometimes return to the mounds, after she
had left them, and transfer a bunch of geraniums
from one to another, and once, she had cleaned
off two of them and piled all of the offerings over
the one near the tree. Sometimes the others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
would have all of the geraniums. The gossips
could see these things, but they could not look
into the secret chambers of Elvirey Smetters’s
heart.</p>

<p>On the walls of such chambers are recorded
something that is never told. Thoughtful deeds,
tender looks of sympathy and understanding, and
years devoted, leave their traces there. With a
thread of gossamer, memory leads us gently to
them, and out into the world again, where we
carry flowers to silent places. The strongest
sometimes become the weakest, but who knows
if such weakness is not the strength of the mighty?</p>

<p>Time had softened the sorrows of Elvirey
Smetters. Little wrinkles were beginning to tell
the story of her passing years, for she was nearly
sixty, and a sense of life’s futility was creeping
over her. She felt the need of new environment
and new sensations.</p>

<p>“Now before you begin talkin’ about any duck
you want to buy,” said Mrs. Smetters, after the
object of the visit was explained, “I want to know
if you’ve seen anythin’ o’ Cal. I ain’t seen ’im
fer a month, an’ if you run across ’im, I want you
to tell ’im I’m sick, an’ ’e better come an’ see how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
I am. I’ll make you a present o’ that duck if
you’ll just walk in on ’im an’ tell ’im sump’n
that don’t look like it come from me, that’ll make
’im come over ’ere. You needn’t let on that I
want to see ’im, but you fix it somehow so’s ’e’ll
<i>come</i>.”</p>

<p>I solemnly promised to do this, but insisted
upon settling for the duck, which was soon dressed
and wrapped in an old copy of <i>The Weekly
Clarion</i>, which was published at the county seat.</p>

<p>“Now you be careful an’ not let ’im know I
said a word about ’im,” was her parting injunction
at the gate, “but <i>you git ’im ’ere</i>, an’ don’t
say nothin’ to Sipes either!”</p>

<p>She was assured that great care would be
exercised.</p>

<p>During the walk through the dunes I mused
upon the wiles of Mrs. Smetters’s sex, and reflected
upon the futility of any attempt to escape
them, when they are practiced by an adept upon
an average man. It is a world-old story&mdash;as
old as the Garden of Eden. The lure of the feminine
rules the earth, and it is a part of the scheme
of things that it should be so. The female of all
breathing creatures controls the wooing&mdash;from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
the lady-bug to Elvirey Smetters. However masculine
vanity may seek to disguise it, the wooer
is as clay in the hands of the potter. The meditations
of some of the world’s greatest men have
been devoted to the complexities of female human
nature, and during these meditations they have
often married.</p>

<p>Along toward noon the duck was turned over
to Sipes in front of his shanty. He was greatly
pleased. It varied the monotony of small gifts
of tobacco and cigars which usually reciprocated
his many hospitalities.</p>

<p>“Elvirey’s got a lot o’ them birds,” he remarked,
“an’ I was goin’ over some night to persuade
one of ’em to come to my shanty. If she
wasn’t a woman, they’d all been gone long ago.
I hear ’em spatterin’ in the ditch ev’ry time I go
by, an’ I often think, s’posen them lily-white
ducks b’longed to some o’ them fellers that set
’round the village store, wot would I do?”</p>

<p>I inquired if he had seen anything of Cal
lately.</p>

<p>“Cal’s snoopin’ ’round ’is coop right now.
You c’n see ’im with the spotter,” said the old
man, as he brought out his rickety old brass spy-glass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Through it I could just make out a figure
moving about on the sand near the distant shanty.</p>

<p>I left the old mariner, intending to come out
of the dunes near Cal’s place sometime during the
afternoon, being really anxious to accommodate
Mrs. Smetters.</p>

<p>In the course of time I reached Cal’s shanty
and found him sharpening a knife near the door.
We shook hands and, after discussing various
matters of mutual interest, I mentioned the call
on Mrs. Smetters for the purpose of buying a
duck for Sipes.</p>

<p>“W’y didn’t you git me a duck too if you was
git’n one fer him?” he asked rather peevishly.
He was placated with a cigar and the explanation
that I had not expected to see him on this trip.
He betrayed no curiosity at the mention of Mrs.
Smetters. I tried again, and told him that I had
had a long talk with her and she did not look as
though she was very well; she appeared sad,
and seemed ill. At this he began to show interest.</p>

<p>“Wot d’ye s’pose is the matter with ’er? W’y
don’t she eat some catnip if she’s sick?”</p>

<p>I replied that probably she found it rather
lonely since her last husband died.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“Say, d’ye know wot I think I’ll do? I’ll go
over there tomorrer an’ take ’er some fresh fish,
an’ mebbe she’ll gimme a duck. I ain’t seen ’er
fer a long time.”</p>

<p>Having approved of his suggestion, and realizing
that the mission had been accomplished, I
departed after we had talked of other things for
a while. Visits to Cal were always enjoyable, although
his reminiscences were to be accepted with
a grain of salt. His logic, morals, and language
were bad, but his narratives had the charm of
originality, and he never failed to be entertaining.
Naturally, I was curious as to the outcome
of the projected call on Mrs. Smetters, but not
being concerned in further developments, I dismissed
it from my mind. Interest was quickly
revived on meeting Sipes a month later.</p>

<p>“Say, wot d’ye think’s happened?” exclaimed
the old man. “Elvirey’s snared Cal good an’
plenty. That ol’ cuss has been up to see ’er a
dozen times in the last two weeks. Bill an’ me’s
been watchin’ ’em with the spotter from up yonder
in them trees on top o’ that big dune where we
c’n see ’er house. Say, you’d laugh yerself sick.
Gener’ly ’e sneaks ’round an’ goes along the edge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
o’ the marsh over back o’ here, so’s ’e won’t ’ave
to go by our place. Last night ’e come by with
a collar on. His whiskers was combed an’ so was
’is hair. He was all lit up an’ reminded Bill an’
me o’ that hiker we found walkin’ on the beach
once’t that we piloted off a couple o’ miles to
show ’im where we told ’im ’e could cetch some
mock-turtles. Bill’s up there with the spotter
watchin’ now. We call that place the masthead.”</p>

<p>Far away I could see the glint of the spy-glass,
and could dimly make out the figure of the lone
sentinel in his eyry upon the height. He was
ensconced in a mass of gnarled and tangled roots
which the wind-blown sand had left bare on the
distant hilltop.</p>

<p>“We got a little place among them roots,”
said the old man, “that jest fits the spotter
w’en it’s trained on Elvirey’s place, an’ all ye
have to do is jest set down an’ look. Bill takes
the fust watch w’en we can’t see nothin’ ’round
Cal’s shanty, an’ I go aloft in the afternoon. We
seen ’im twice yisterd’y. Him an’ Elvirey was
out in the yard waterin’ the flowers. I s’pose
she wants to keep ’em growin’ nice so’s she c’n
lay ’em over Cal like she does the others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>“If there’s sump’n doin’ at Elvirey’s, Bill’ll
hang a rag on that big dead limb ye see stickin’
out, an’ it’s there now!” The fluttering signal
of “sump’n doin’” was faintly visible.</p>

<p>“That rag’s jest to show he’s seen Cal over
there, an’ if ’e thinks I oughta come up, ’e’ll
put out another in a minute. That ’ud mean
that they was set’n out in the yard, er goin’ off
som’er’s together, mebbe to the village.” We kept
our eyes on the summit for some time, but the
second signal did not appear.</p>

<p>A week later I found Cal at the home of the
old shipmates. He looked rather crestfallen. An
air of embarrassment and restraint seemed to pervade
the place. I feared that I had intruded, and
was going away, when Sipes insisted that I remain
and go out on the lake with him. He
thought that a recent storm might have damaged
his gill-nets and wanted to look them over. After
Cal’s departure we shoved the row-boat into the
water. On the way out to the nets the old man
told me the thrilling tale of the love of Happy
Cal and Elvirey Smetters.</p>

<p>“This Elvirey’s a queer ol’ girl,” he began.
“Them husbands she’s been git’n a c’lection of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
over in the cemetery was a bum lot. Before she
begun git’n married ’er name was Prokop. Fust
she married a feller named Swisher, an’ she was
livin’ with ’im w’en I fust come in the hills. He
was no good, an’ I never liked ’is name. It
sounded kind o’ fishy an’ whistley to me. After
a while Swisher commenced git’n thin an’ all
yellow, an’ one day ’e skipped. She lit out after
’im an’ brought ’im back from over to the county
seat. He died about a month later of sump’n
the doctor said ’ad busted up ’is liver. He left
’er that little place, where she lives.</p>

<p>“The next feller’s name was Smythe, an’ ’e
was a funny lookin’ gink. He was runnin’ a little
circus wot went ’round the country in the summer.
He used to wear high brown boots with ’is
trowsies stuck in ’em, an’ a velvet vest, with a
watch chain that weighed about a pound. He had
a wide gray hat, an’ a red neck-tie with a hunk
o’ glass on it, an’ a long moustache that looked
like a feather duster. He looked fierce, but
Elvirey fell fer ’im w’en she seen ’im out in front
of ’is tent on a box doin’ a lot o’ funny tricks
with cards fer the crowd. The circus busted up
an’ ’e moved over to Elvirey’s place. The circus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
posters said ’is name was Blondini, but ’is real
name was Smith. He wrote it Smythe, so’s to
make folks think ’e had money an’ was a society
bug. He died o’ sump’n, I don’t know wot it
was, an’ then poor ol’ Smetters come along. He
was a fat feller. He painted the house, an’ fussed
’round on the place fer a year, an’ then ’ad fits.
His conniptions would come on most any time,
an’ Elvirey let ol’ Doc Looney in on to ’im one
night, an’ the next mornin’ ’e was dead. The
Doc ’ad given ’im some horse medicine, an’ it
finished ’im.</p>

<p>“Them three are all layin’ side by side, wait’n
fer Cal, fer ’e told us this mornin’ that ’im an’
Elvirey’s goin’ to git married.</p>

<p>“Bill an’ me seen ’em from the masthead yisterd’y,
walkin’ down the road. They set down
on the grass, an’ we sneaked over an’ got behind
some bushes, an’ we heard ’im callin’ ’er ‘kitten’
an’ she was callin’ ’im a duck. Bill says, ‘Look
at them columbines!’ an’ we busted out laughin’.
Then they both roasted us fer listenin’. Cal was
dead sore, but ’e didn’t say very much. Elvirey
pretty near killed Bill with a big stick, an’ knocked
’im into the bushes. He got up an’ lit out, an’ so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
did I, fer after Bill was down she started fer me.
I didn’t need no clubbin’ an’ scooted. She chased
me a ways, but I got home all right. I wonder
w’y them that gits love-sick always calls each
other animals an’ birds?”</p>

<p>During Sipes’s narrative I felt a pang of regret
that I had not spent the day at “the masthead,”
for evidently it would have been worth while.</p>

<p>“Cal come over today an’ we had a long talk,”
continued the old man. “He said ’e hoped they
wasn’t no hard feelin’s, ’cause ’e hadn’t started
nothin’ an’ it was us fellers’ fault that Elvirey
got to goin’. Bill ’ad a bump on ’is head as big
as an aig, but we all shook hands an’ agreed to
call it off. An’ now comes this damn wedd’n
they’re goin’ to have. Cal says they’re goin’ to
be married by Holy Zeke, an’ wot d’ye think?
they want to have the wedd’n in our shanty,
’cause Elvirey says she won’t let Bill an’ me come
to her house, an’ Cal won’t be married ’less ’e
c’n ’ave ’is friends with ’im. His shanty ain’t
big enough fer the bunch, an’ ours is halfway
between, so they’ve fixed on that, an’ we’re in
fer it.</p>

<p>“I don’t know wot Cal’s goin’ to do about ’is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
last name that ’e’s got to be married with. He
says ’e’s been livin’ alone so long ’e’s fergot wot
it is, an’ we got to pick out a new one fer ’im.
I told ’im ’e better call it Mud, but ’e didn’t cetch
on to no joke. Wouldn’t that make a fine soundin’
lot o’ names fer Elvirey’s lot in the church-yard?
Swisher, Smythe, Smetters, an’ Mud! Ev’rybody’d
stop to look at ’em.</p>

<p>“Cal’s gone to tell John, an’ Saturd’y night
him an’ Holy Zeke’ll come down, an’ Cal’s kitten’s
going to fetch a cake. Cal said you was invited,
an’ if you got any business to close up ’fore you
come, you’d better ’tend to it, fer mebbe hell’ll
be to pay ’fore it’s over. I’ll bet Elvirey won’t
stand fer me an’ Bill w’en she sees wot we’re
goin’ to do to the shanty fer the wedd’n.”</p>

<p>After inspecting the nets we returned, and I
promised to be on hand Saturday evening. Sipes
requested me to come early, “so as to think o’
sump’n us fellers might fergit.”</p>

<p>I looked forward to Saturday with eager anticipation,
and arrived at the shanty just before
dusk. Evidently the old shipmates had been
very busy. They were in high spirits.</p>

<p>A couple of old fish-nets were stretched from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
each side of the door, in parallel lines, to a point
about fifty feet away on the sand. Boards, obtained
from among the driftwood on the beach, had
been laid along between them. “Bill’s a big help
about them things,” said the old man. “He says
it’s ’is habit w’en ’e gits married to have sump’n
like that stretched out fer the bride to walk between
so’s nobody’ll try to steal ’er at the last
minute.”</p>

<p>The roof of the shanty was thickly covered with
dead leaves, held in place by more nets which
were laid over them and weighted with stones.
“We could ’a’ got green ones,” said Sipes, “but
them old leaves looks more fit like. They wasn’t
neither of ’em born yisterd’y.</p>

<p>The rusty stove-pipe, which served as a chimney,
had been carefully wrapped in white cloth,
at least it had once been white, and a long strip
of bright red material had been tied to it, which
fluttered in the breeze. Sipes said that this was
the danger signal. A large bunch of bulrushes
and cat-tails was stuffed into the top of the
stove-pipe.</p>

<p>The sign on the shanty&mdash;

<span class="table">

<span class="figcenter">$IPE$ &amp; $AUNDER$&mdash;FRE$H FI$H</span></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
had been covered with a strip of rotten canvas,
on which was painted,

<span class="table">

<span class="figcenter">Many <span class="smcap">Happ</span>y Re<small>TURNS</small></span>
</span></p>

<p>The conspirators had gathered a lot of thistle
blossoms, with plenty of the leaves, with which
they had festooned the interior. An old beer-keg,
mounted on a box, which stood at one end of
the single room, was to serve as the altar. On
it were two lemons, with which time had not
dealt very gently. Their significance was not
explained.</p>

<p>All over the shanty, where the decorations did
not interfere, were groups of four vertical chalk-lines.
“Them marks is Elvirey’s score,” explained
the old man.</p>

<p>A nail keg, with one end knocked out, hung
endwise above the altar, and in the opening a
large ripe tomato was suspended from the inside
by a string. On the keg was painted a large
figure 4. “That there’s the marriage bell,” said
Sipes.</p>

<p>A lantern on a hook in the ceiling, and a dozen
candle stubs were to furnish illumination. The
music was also provided for. There was a covered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
box near the wall, with gimlet holes all over it,
that evidently contained something alive.</p>

<p>“That’s full o’ hummin’ locusts that me an’
Bill caught,” said Sipes, “an’ when Zeke says
it’s all over, I’ll hammer on the box an’ them
little singers’ll git busy. We tried ’em this
mornin’ an’ it works fine.”</p>

<p>The stove was stuffed with stray pieces of old
leather and rubber boots, mixed with oiled rags.
“W’en we light that fire, with the chimbly
stopped up with them cat-tails, it’ll show that
the party’s over,” chuckled the old man.</p>

<p>The arrangements seemed quite complete, and
I had no suggestions to offer. The wedding
party was to assemble around a drift-wood fire
on the sand, some distance away, and proceed
to the shanty at eight o’clock. A huge pile of
material for the bonfire had been gathered.</p>

<p>The flames soon crackled merrily and lit up the
beach. The red light touched the crests of the little
waves that lapped the shore, and bathed the side of
the sandy bluff with a mellow glow. It illuminated
the shanty which, with its grotesque decorations,
relieved against the dark green of the ravine beyond,
resembled a stage setting for a comic opera.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>The wedding guests soon began to arrive.
“Catfish John,” with a large package under
his arm, accompanied by Holy Zeke, were the
first comers, after the fire was lighted. They had
walked a long distance, and sat down wearily on
the sand, after the conventional greetings. John’s
package probably contained some smoked fish
which he intended as a present for the bride.
Sipes sniffed at it with evident approval.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Mrs. Smetters arrived with
her friend Mrs. McCafferty, who carried the cake
in a basket. Mrs. McCafferty lived in the sleepy
village, several miles away. She was to act as
bridesmaid, and was to “give the bride away,”
which Sipes declared she would “do anyhow
afterwards if she didn’t do it now.” She was a
buxom Irish widow, with a fighting record, and
a mind of her own. She had brought Mrs. Smetters
to the wedding with her buggy and gray
horse, which had been left where the sloping road
ended in the beach sand. It was her custom to attend
all of Elvirey’s weddings in the same capacity.
She was her bosom friend and confidante.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smetters was attired in a new white muslin
dress, with a bountiful corsage bouquet of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
white peonies. She was bareheaded, and lilies
of the valley accented the bricky red of her hair.
As at all weddings, “the bride was very beautiful.”</p>

<p>We rose and greeted the ladies cordially. Mrs.
Smetters looked inquiringly around for Cal, but
he had not yet arrived. She then seated herself
on the shawl which Mrs. McCafferty carefully
spread out on the sand. No reference was made
to the stormy scene of the interrupted wooing of
a few days before. Bill was still nursing his sore
head, but made no unpleasant allusions.</p>

<p>The hour had arrived, but the party was
still incomplete. Happy Cal was conspicuously
absent.</p>

<p>“Mebbe he’s doin’ a lot o’ fixin’ up an’ can’t
find ’is perfumery, er mebbe he’s fergot about the
wedd’n,” observed Sipes.</p>

<p>An angry glance from Mrs. Smetters was the
only response to this sally.</p>

<p>The ladies looked curiously at the shanty, and
Sipes had much difficulty in keeping them away
from it. He announced that “they wasn’t goin’
to be no rubberin’ ’round the place ’till the
wedd’n.” They started several times, but were
persuaded to wait until Cal came.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>An hour slipped by, and the delinquent did not
appear.</p>

<p>“Lo, the bridegroom cometh not,” said Holy
Zeke, solemnly.</p>

<p>Clouds of feminine wrath were gathering on the
other side of the fire.</p>

<p>“We’re goin’ over to see them fixin’s,” announced
Mrs. Smetters, with determination. “This
is wot I git fer wearin’ my heart on my sleeve!”</p>

<p>I walked along the beach in the hope that I
might meet Cal. Sipes went to the shanty and
lit the lantern and the candles. The two females
led the rest of the party along between the nets.
After they entered it took them but a few seconds
to fully comprehend the <i>tout ensemble</i>, and then
came the event of the evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. McCafferty started to swoon, but suddenly
revived when Mrs. Smetters hurled a stove-lid
at Sipes, followed by the keg from the altar.
The male members of the party beat a rapid retreat
through the door into the welcome shadows.
Sipes ran in my direction. We stood about a
hundred yards away in the darkness, and surveyed
the scene.</p>

<p>With the fury of a woman scorned, Elvirey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
was smashing up the place. With the able help
of her bosom friend, every movable breakable
thing was being destroyed and thrown out. The
window was demolished early in the proceedings,
and through the broken sash went wrecked cooking
utensils, blankets, guns, cards, bottles, boxes,
pieces of the table, and other things, too numerous
to mention. Amid loud blows of an axe, the
side of the shanty began to give way.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard piercing shrieks, and the
two maddened women fled wildly from the shanty
in the direction of the buggy.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet they’ve busted open them insects!”
exclaimed Sipes.</p>

<p>We waited a while, and looked for the other
members of the party. We called repeatedly, but
no answer came out of the gloom. They had
been swallowed in the blackness of the night.</p>

<p>We then went to inspect the wreck. All of the
old shipmates’ efforts to make the wedding a success
had been “love’s labor lost.” The decorations
were mingled with fragments of the stove
and the splintered bunks. There seemed to be
nothing in the place that was breakable that had
not been attended to. The “hummin’ locusts”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
were innocently crawling about the floor and
walls.</p>

<p>“We might as well c’lect this music an’ put it
out,” said Sipes, ruefully, as he began picking up
the locusts. “We wouldn’t ’a’ had no shanty
left if it hadn’t been fer them. I guess I must ’a’
started sump’n. After this I’m goin to let ev’ry
feller run ’is own business, an’ me an’ Bill’ll flock
by ourselves. Look wot I git fer tryin’ to please
ev’rybody all the time! Somebody’s always
butt’n in an’ spoilin’ ev’rythin’ I try to do. I
got hit with too damn many things out o’ the air
tonight to be happy. Wot d’ye ’spose become
o’ Cal? He’d ’a’ got a lemon if ’e’d ’a’ married
that ol’ swivel-eyed sliver-cat. I’m goin’ up in the
ravine to sleep, an’ mebbe Bill’ll show up in the
mornin’. Say, wot do <i>you</i> think o’ matrimony,
anyway? Gosh! but this is rough work. Bill
an’ me was in a hurricane once’t out’n the Pacific&mdash;the
ship’s rudder got busted off an’ we was
spun along on the equator fer a thousand miles,
but that wasn’t nothin’ ’side o’ this.”</p>

<p>The old man stood disconsolate among his
ruins. There was gloom on his face as I bade
him good-night, and there was a pressure in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
hand grasp, as of one who did not want to be left
alone. From a distance down the shore I could
see the flickering light of the expiring bonfire,
playing upon the scene of the recent drama, as
fate toys with the destinies of human lives.</p>

<p>Cal’s failure to appear at his wedding was
never accounted for. The following week we
found his shanty deserted. Its simple furnishings
and Cal’s boat were gone.</p>

<p>“That ol’ skeesicks ’as got more sense than I
ever thought, an’ ’e’s skipped. He’ll be number
four in that cemetery lot all right if ’e ever shows
up,” declared Sipes as we parted. “She rough-housed
me when I didn’t do nothin’, an’ I wouldn’t
like to see Cal’s finish if she ever gits to ’im. The
feller that ought to marry Hellfirey Smetters is
Holy Zeke.”</p>

<p>Perhaps from somewhere out in the darkness,
Cal may have studied the group around the fire
on the sand. Its light may have reflected the
quiet gleam of tigerish ferocity that creeps into
the eyes of a woman who is made to wait. He
may have been appalled by the prospect of the
loss of his much-loved freedom, and recoiled from
further contact with a social system which had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
discarded him, or he may have seen his “kitten”
in a new light that dissipated illusion.</p>

<p>Anyway, as Sipes declared, “Elvirey’s duck”
had “lit out.”</p>

<p>During a visit to Mrs. Smetters late in the fall,
she gloomily remarked, “Now if <i>you</i> will tell <i>me</i>
wot’s the <i>use o’ livin’</i>, I’d be <i>very grateful</i>!”

THE RESURRECTION OF BILL
SAUNDERS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Sipes</span> and Saunders had acquired a detachable
motor for their boat. Catfish
John had obtained it on one of his various
trips to the little village at the mouth of the
river about fifteen miles away. The disgusted
owner had traded it in on his fish account with
John, and had thrown in, as a bonus, some gasoline,
mixing oil, a lot of damaged small tools, a
much-worn book of instructions, and a great deal
of conversation. He was careful to impress on
John that he wanted no “come back,” and was
not responsible in any way for what the contraption
might or might not do after it left him. He
had just had it “overhauled” by the makers for
the third time, and he never wanted to see it again.</p>

<p>John, knowing the great persistence and ingenuity
of his friends, and feeling that he was in the
way of doing them a favor, put the despised machine
in his wagon and departed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>The following morning he drove up the beach
to the fish shanty for his supplies.</p>

<p>“Wot’s all this iron fickits?” asked Sipes, as
he peered curiously into the wagon.</p>

<p>“That’s a gas motor wot ye stick on the back
o’ yer boat. You fill up the tin thing with gasoline
an’ some kind of oil, an’ then whirl that wheel
wot’s got the little wooden handle on it, an’ ’way
she goes an’ runs yer boat, an’ ye don’t ’ave to
row, an’ ye c’n go anywheres whar it’s wet. I
traded wot a feller owed me fer ’bout fifty
pounds o’ fish fer it, an’ if you fellers want it, ye
c’n ’ave it if ye gimme the fish.”</p>

<p>“Bill, come ’ere!” yelled Sipes.</p>

<p>The tousled gray head of Bill Saunders appeared
in the doorway of the shanty.</p>

<p>“Wot’s doin’?” he asked sleepily.</p>

<p>“Never you mind; you put on yer trowsies an’
come on out ’ere an’ see wot our ol’ friend an’
feller-citizen ’as fetched in.”</p>

<p>Without following Sipes’s instructions implicitly,
the disturbed occupant of the shanty came
out to the wagon.</p>

<p>“This ’ere little book wot the feller gave me,”
continued John, “has got it all in, with pitchers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
of all the little things in the machine, an’ how to
grease it, an’ run it, an’ ev’rythin’ about it.
Thar’s a lot o’ figgers in it wot tells wot ye pay
fer all the things that gits busted.”</p>

<p>On the cover of the worn book, which the old
man produced, was a highly colored picture of a
slender youth, gay and debonair, with one of the
machines in a canvas carrying bag. He swung it
lightly and merrily in his hand as he tripped along
toward his boat, which floated in the distance,
where soft ripples laved its polished sides with
pink water. His derby hat was tilted to a careless
angle. On his face was a smile of joyful anticipation.
There was no more suggestion of
exertion than if the bag contained toy balloons
instead of a motor. Nevertheless it required the
united efforts of the three weather-buffeted old
fishermen to get the machine out of the wagon
on to the beach. Such is the contrast between
exuberant youth and seasoned maturity.</p>

<p>“I bet that feller with the hard-boiled hat ain’t
got the machine in that bag at all,” remarked
Saunders, as he studied the scene on the cover.
“They’s prob’ly some fellers follerin’ ’im with it
that don’t show in the pitcher. I don’t like that cigarette
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
moustache on ’im; I’ll bet ’e knows durned
little ’bout navigation ’ceptin’ with crackers on
soup. You leave this thing ’ere an’ me an’ Sipes’ll
try ’er out, an’ if it works, we’ll keep ’er. Anyhow
we’ll make up the fish yer out an’ you won’t lose
nothin’.”</p>

<p>The fish for John’s peddling trip were carefully
sorted out and recorded by Sipes, with a stubby
pencil, on the inside of the shanty door where the
accounts were kept. The nets had been lifted in
the early morning and the supply was abundant.
When John had sold the fish the proceeds were
to be divided equally.</p>

<p>After John and his aged horse “Napoleon” had
left with the slimy merchandise, the old shipmates
sat down and considered the apparatus.</p>

<p>To this primitive coast, torn by the storms and
yellowed by the suns of thousands of years, where
elemental forces had ruled since the beginning,
had come a strange and misfitting thing. It
seemed an unhallowed and discordant intrusion
into the Great Harmonies. Somehow we can, in
a measure, be reconciled, poetically, to the use
of steam, without great violence to our worship
of the grandeur of nature’s forces, but there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
no poetry in a gasoline engine. It is a fiend that
wars upon things spiritual. Its dissonant soul-offending
clatter on the rivers that flow gently
through venerable woods, and out in the solitudes
of wide and quiet waters is profanation.</p>

<p>Utilitarianism and ideality clashed when the
motor touched the beach, but these things did not
disturb Sipes and Saunders, engaged in the contemplation
of the machine, as bewildered savages
might gaze upon a fragment of a meteor that
had dropped out of the sky from another world.</p>

<p>After a while they lugged it to the shanty. “I
could ’a’ carried it alone if I’d ’a’ had one o’ them
darby hats on!” declared Sipes.</p>

<p>They spent long hours over the book of instructions,
and the light in the shanty burned far
into the night. They carefully and repeatedly
examined the various parts in connection with
the text. There were some words which they did
not understand, but they finally felt that they had
mastered the problem.</p>

<p>Saunders remarked, as they turned into their
bunks, “I guess we got ’er, Sipes. We’ll pour in
the juice an’ start ’er up in the mornin’. Then
we’ll buzz off on the lake an’ look at the nets.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>“She oughta have a name on ’er, like a boat,”
suggested Sipes. “S’pose we call ’er the ‘Anabel,’
er sump’n like that?”</p>

<p>“‘Anabel’ ain’t no kind of a name fer anythin’
o’ this kind. I seen that name on a sailboat
once’t that didn’t make no noise at all, an’ this
thing will. Wot’s the matter with ‘June Bug’?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sipes, “‘June Bug’ she is, now
let’s go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Loud snores resounded in the shanty, and the
“June Bug” spent the night on the floor near the
stove. Fortunately there was no leak in the gasoline
tank or fire in the stove.</p>

<p>With the coming of dawn the old cronies hastily
prepared breakfast. The lake was calm and
everything seemed propitious for the initial voyage
with the June Bug. That deceptive bit of
machinery was carefully carried to the big flat-bottomed
boat, and, after an hour of hard work,
was securely attached to the wide stem. The
gasoline tank was filled to the top, the batteries
adjusted, the spark tested, and every detail
seemed to tally with the directions. Sipes gave
the fly-wheel a couple of quick turns. The motor
responded instantly. The propeller ran in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
air with a cheerful hum, and the regular detonations
of the little engine awoke the echoes along
the shore.</p>

<p>With shouts of boyish glee the old shipmates
pushed the big boat over the rollers on the sand
and down into the water. There was much discussion
as to which should run the engine and
steer. Sipes produced a penny and, by flipping it
skilfully, won the decision.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose they’s any use takin’ the oars,
but I’ll put ’em in,” he observed as he threw them
into the boat.</p>

<p>Saunders complacently took his place forward.
Sipes gave the boat a final shove and jumped in.
He pushed it well out with one of the oars, and
turned and looked with pride on the wonderful
labor-saving device on the stern. It seemed too
good to be true.</p>

<p>“Say, Bill, to think that us fellers c’n go hundreds
o’ miles out’n the lake, if we want to, an’
ev’rywhere else, an’ let this dingus do all the
work. We c’n set an’ smoke an’ watch the foam,
an’ listen to the hummin’ o’ the Bug. I’ve heard
fellers go by way out b’yond the nets with them
choo-choo boats, but I never seen wot did it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
before. Gosh! but this is fine. Now all we gotta
do is to touch ’er off an’ away we go!”</p>

<p>The old man’s single eye beamed with enthusiasm,
as he grasped the handle and made the
prescribed turns. The result was a couple of
pops and some coughing sounds somewhere in the
concealed iron recesses.</p>

<p>“Guess she’s coy, an’ I didn’t give ’er enough.
I’ll whirl ’er some more.” His efforts were again
ineffectual.</p>

<p>“Lemme try ’er,” pleaded Saunders.</p>

<p>“Not on yer life! You keep off. You don’t
know nothin’ ’bout machines. She’ll be all right
in a minute. Gimme that book!”</p>

<p>The boat drifted sideways for some time while
Sipes studied the directions and puttered over the
parts with various tools.</p>

<p>“I’ll jolly ’er up with the screw-driver an’
monkey-wrench, an’ she’ll feel better.” He tinkered
and cranked for nearly an hour, during
which time Saunders offered many ill-received
suggestions. Then came a torrent of invective.</p>

<p>“You got too many whiskers to swear like
that,” remarked Saunders, “you’ll burn ’em.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind, I’m watchin’ ’em! The man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
wot ’ud make a thing like this, an’ take good cash
money fer it, er even fish, oughta be cut up an’
sizzled!” he declared. “The skin’s all offen my
hands, an’ I wish the devil wot built this gas bug
’ud ’ave to keep ’is head in hot tar ’til she went.
Come ’ere, Bill, an’ start ’er up. You seem to
know so much about it.”</p>

<p>They exchanged places and Sipes glared maliciously
at the rebellious motor from the bow.
Saunders put his pipe in his pocket, produced a
chunk of “plug twist,” and bit off a large piece.
He stowed it comfortably and considered the
problem before him. After a couple of hours of
fruitless efforts the profanity in the boat became
unified and vociferous. The ancestors of the
makers of the motor, and those of the man who
had it last, as well as the undoubted destiny of
everybody who had ever had any connection with
it, were embraced in sulphuric execration. John
was, in a way, excepted. He “meant well,” but
he was “a damned old fool.”</p>

<p>After this general vituperation the old sailors
rested for a while and rowed back. The constant
cranking had turned the propeller a great many
times. The boat had made erratic headway and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
was quite a distance from shore. They landed,
pulled the boat out on the sand with the windlass,
and retired to the shanty for lunch and
consultation.</p>

<p>Saunders strolled out a little later, with a piece
of cold fried fish in his hand, and looked the motor
over again. He gave the fly-wheel a careless turn
and the engine started off gayly. Sipes heard the
welcome sound and ran out, spilling his coffee
over the door step. Lunch was discontinued, and
the boat was re-floated. There was more cranking,
but no answering vibrations. With more
profanity the craft was restored to its berth on
the sand, and another retreat made to the shanty.</p>

<p>“The Bug’ll run all right on land,” declared
Sipes, “an’ we’ll turn the propeller so’s the edges’ll
be fore an’ aft, an’ belay it. We’ll bend a rim
on it an’ fasten some little truck wheels on the
bottom o’ the boat. Then we’ll run the ol’ girl
up an’ down on the hard sand ’long the edge o’
the water. We won’t go in the lake at all ’til
we git ’er well het up, an’ then we’ll turn ’er in
sudden an’ cut them lashin’s. She won’t know
she’s in an’ ’way she’ll go.”</p>

<p>For many days the old shipmates struggled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
with the obstinate mechanism. It once ran for
an hour without a break and they were jubilant.
“Some gas bug that!” Saunders exclaimed joyfully,
but just then it sputtered and stopped.
They were quite a ways out, and the oars had
been forgotten. Fortunately there was a light
in-shore breeze and they drifted to the beach about
two miles from home.</p>

<p>The oars were finally procured and the day
closed with everything snug and tight at the
shanty.</p>

<p>“I bet we ain’t got the right kind o’ gasoline,”
declared Sipes. “They’s lots o’ kinds. This ’ere
wot’s in the Bug ain’t got no kick to it. We got
too much oil mixed in it, an’ we gotta git s’more.”</p>

<p>When John came again the many troubles were
related to him. He knew nothing of motors, but
offered to get some more gasoline when he went
to the village, and to bring the former owner of
the motor over to see if he could suggest anything.</p>

<p>“You jest fetch that feller,” said Sipes, “an’
we’ll take ’im out fer a nice little spin on the lake,
an’ we’ll go where it’s deep.”</p>

<p>When the new gasoline came there was much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
more tinkering and study of the directions.
Resignation alternated with hope. Sometimes
the motor would run, but more often it refused.
John finally took it to the village and it was
shipped to the makers. A carefully and painfully
composed letter was put in the “pustoffice.”
The long-delayed answer was that the machine
needed “overhauling,” which would cost about
half as much as a new one.</p>

<p>“The money that them pie-biters makes ain’t
sellin’ motors, but overhaulin’ ’em,” declared
Sipes. They sell one o’ them bum things an’ git
their hooks in an’ git a stiddy income from it
long as you’ll stand fer it.”</p>

<p>It was decided, after much discussion, to send
the money “fer the overhaulin’.” Several months
elapsed. The machine came back too late to be
of further use that season, and was carefully
stowed away for the winter.</p>

<p>“She’ll prob’ly need another ‘overhaulin’’ in
the spring ’fore she’ll go, an’ them fellers’ll want
to nick us ag’in an’ keep ’er all next summer,” said
Saunders. “If they charged by the days they
kep’ ’er instid o’ by the job, we’d be busted.
They’ll bust us anyhow, an’ it might as well be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
all at one crack. The Bug’s goin’ to stay in the
house now, where she won’t git wet. She ain’t
goin’ out on the vasty deep no more ’til spring.
If she gits uneasy, she c’n run ’round in ’ere.”</p>

<p>The following May I called at the shanty and
found Sipes sitting disconsolately in the door-way.
After visiting with him for a while, I inquired for
Saunders.</p>

<p>“Poor Bill’s dead. I ain’t got no partner now
an’ it’s awful lonesome. He was a nice ol’ feller.
He fussed ’round with the gas bug fer days an’
days, an’ ’e couldn’t make it go. He come in
one night late, an’ the next mornin’ ’e didn’t git
up. He didn’t seem in ’is right mind. His hand
’ud keep goin’ ’round an’ ’round, like it was
crankin’ sump’n. Then ’e’d make sputterin’
sounds with ’is mouth like as if a motor was
goin’, an’ then ’e’d keep still a long time like the
Bug does, an’ then begin ag’in. He wouldn’t eat
nothin’, an’ one night he said ’e guessed ’e needed
overhaulin’. Then ’e said ‘choo-choo! choo-choo!’
three er four times, an’ ’e was gone. Come on
with me an’ I’ll show you where ’e was laid away.”</p>

<p>We walked along the shore a short distance,
crossed the beach and climbed the bluff. Near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the foot of an old pine was a mound, on which
was scattered the dried remnants of many spring
flowers, which probably had come from the low
ground in the ravine. Several bunches of white
trilliums, with their leaves and roots, had been
transplanted to the mound, but they had withered
and died. A wide board, which protruded
from the ground at the head of the grave, bore
the rude inscription:

<span class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" id="i148" src="images/i148.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="figcenter">BiLL SauNDERS&mdash;DEAD</span></span>

Under the name was a rough drawing of the fly-wheel
of the motor, evidently made with Sipes’s
stubby pencil.</p>

<p>Chiselled epitaphs on granite tombs have said,
but told no more.</p>

<p>We stood for some time before the mound.
The old sailor wiped a tear from his single eye as
we left Bill’s last resting place in silence and
sorrow.</p>

<p>“Him an’ me was shipmates,” said the old man
sadly, as we returned to the shanty. “I off’n go
up there an’ set down an’ think about ’im. Bill
was honest. They’s lots o’ fellers that wouldn’t
swipe nothin’ that was red-hot an’ nailed down,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
’spesh’ly ’round ’ere, but Bill never’d touch
nothin’ that didn’t b’long to him er me. It was
the gas bug that killed ’im. Fust it made ’im
daffy an’ then it finished ’im. She’s over there
now on the stern o’ the boat. I ain’t never had
’er out this year, but I’m goin’ to try ’er once’t,
jest fer Bill’s sake. I think ’e’d like to have me
do it.”</p>

<p>After many condolences, and a general review
of the Bug’s disgraceful career by Sipes, I picked
up my sketching outfit and resumed my journey,
depressed, as we all are, by a sense of the transience
and unsolvable mystery of life, when we
have stood near one who has gone.</p>

<p>One calm morning, about a month later, I was
rowing on the lake several miles from Sipes’s
shanty. A boat appeared in the distance. Its
high sides, broad beam, the labored, intermittent
coughing of a motor, and the doughty little bewhiskered
figure on the stern seat were unmistakable.
Sipes altered his course slightly so as
to pass within fifty or sixty yards. I wondered
why he did not come nearer. He went on by
with a cheery “Wot Oh!” and a friendly wave
of his hand. Evidently he was on some errand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
that he did not want to explain, or was afraid to
stop the motor, fearing that it would not start
again. In a few weeks I encountered him again,
under almost identical conditions. His nets were
nowhere in the vicinity.</p>

<p>In the early fall I found an old flat-roofed hut,
built with faced logs, about six miles down the
coast, in the direction that the old man had been
going when I had last seen him. It was in a
hollow near the top of a high bluff that faced the
lake. It was effectually hidden from the water
and shore by a bank of sand and tangled growth
along the edge of the bluff. Built against the
outside was a large dilapidated brick chimney,
entirely out of proportion in size to the cabin.
No smoke issued from it and the place seemed
deserted. I went down to the beach. A mile or
so further on I found a fisherman repairing a boat
on the sand, and asked him about the cabin.</p>

<p>“That place is witched,” he declared. “Thar’s
funny doin’s ’round thar at night an’ don’t you
go near it. Thar’s a white thing that dances on
the roof. It goes up an’ down an’ out o’ sight,
an’ then thar’s a big thunderin’ noise. I don’t
want to know no more ’bout it’n I know now. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
don’t look right to me. I seen a wild man ’round
’ere in the woods once’t, a couple o’ years ago,
an’ mebbe he lived thar an’ ’e’s dead an’ ’e hants
that place. I don’t come ’round ’ere often an’ I
don’t want to.”</p>

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell">THE “BOGIE HOUSE”</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">(<i>From the Author’s Etching</i>)</span>
</p></div>

<p>My curiosity was aroused and I decided to
investigate the mystery when an opportunity
came. About nine o’clock one night I walked up
a little trail in the sand that led toward the cabin
from the woods back of the bluff. There was a
dim light inside that was extinguished when I
carelessly stepped on a mass of dead brush that
had been piled across the path. The breaking of
the little sticks had made quite a noise. Immediately
a long, wavy, white object appeared over
the roof of the cabin. It vaguely resembled a
human shape and looked peculiarly uncanny. It
swayed back and forth a few times and then
seemed to grow taller. The trees beyond were
partially visible through it in the uncertain light.
Clearly I was in the presence of a spook. The
apparition vanished as suddenly as it came.
Then a dull, hollow sound came from the cabin,
followed by a low, rasping, ringing noise. When
it ceased, the silence was weird and oppressive.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>I went on by the structure to the edge of the
bluff, where another pile of dry brush obstructed
the path, and purposely walked on it, instead of
over the high sand on the sides of the opening.
The breaking sticks made more noise. I turned
and again saw the spectral form over the roof.
The wraith swayed slowly to the right and left,
bent backward and forward a few times, grew
longer and shorter, and disappeared as before.</p>

<p>In departing I stumbled over a board which
stuck out of the sand, and in the dim light could
distinguish the words “Dinnymite&mdash;Keep Out!”
heavily scrawled on it with red paint.</p>

<p>Evidently visitors were not wanted, and the
tell-tale brush-piles were designed to give alarm
of the approach of intruders. The functions of
the filmy ghost and the queer sounds were to
inspire terror of the place.</p>

<p>I related my experience to Sipes the next time
I saw him. He was deeply interested.</p>

<p>“Did ye hear any groanin’ after them funny
sounds?” he asked, with a quizzical look in his
eye. I replied that I had not.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye wot we’ll do,” said he, after a few
moments of reflection, “you an’ me’ll go down to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
that bogie house some time an’ we’ll butt in an’
see wot’s doin’. I gotta go that way in the boat
next week. We’ll take the gun, an’ mebbe we’ll
blow that bogie offen the top o’ the house. I seen
that place last year an’ I know where it is.”</p>

<p>I did not approve of the idea of needlessly invading
the privacy of anybody who did not want
to see us, and who had inhospitably stocked their
domain with brush-piles, ghosts, and forbidding
placards, but there was a strange look in Sipes’s
eye that convinced me that the trip might in some
way be justified.</p>

<p>On the appointed day we made the start. “I
always spend jest an hour tunin’ up the Bug,”
remarked the old man, as he began cranking the
motor, “an’ then if she don’t pop, I cuss ’er out
fer jest fifteen minutes, an’ then I row. Hell, I
gotta have some system!”</p>

<p>Fortunately the Bug was in good humor and
took us three-quarters of the distance without a
break. It then went to sleep, and half an hour’s
cranking and assiduous doctoring failed to arouse it.</p>

<p>“I got a great scheme,” said Sipes. “W’en
she gits like that I fasten the steerin’ gear solid
fer the way I want to go, an’ then w’en I keep on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
crankin’, the propeller goes ’round an’ ’round,
an’ I keep goin’ some.”</p>

<p>A little later a single turn of the fly-wheel
started the treacherous device, but it was going
backward. Sipes promptly seized the oars
and turned the stern of the boat toward our
destination.</p>

<p>“We got ’er now! Jest keep quiet an’ touch
wood! Sometimes she likes to do that, an’ if I
try to reverse ’er she’ll balk. She thinks it’s time
to go home, but it ain’t. This crawfish navigat’n’s
fine w’en ye git used to it.”</p>

<p>We landed beyond a point on the beach which
was opposite to the cabin. After we had secured
the boat to some heavy drift-wood with a long
rope, I followed Sipes up the side of a bluff west
of the cabin. We made a detour through the
woods and approached it at dusk. The dry brush-piles
practically surrounded it at a distance of
about fifty yards.</p>

<p>“Don’t step on none o’ them sticks,” cautioned
Sipes. He gave a low, peculiar whistle, which was
answered from the cabin. “That there’s the high
sign,” he remarked, as we walked to the door.
We were greeted by Bill Saunders, alive and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the flesh. He seemed surprised that Sipes had
brought a visitor, but was very cordial. Sipes
greatly enjoyed the situation and chuckled over
what he considered an immense joke.</p>

<p>“You see it’s like this,” he explained. “Bill
got to thinkin’ wot’s the use o’ gasoline? W’y
not have sump’n that ’ud run ferever, an’ not
’ave to keep buyin’ that stuff all the time? He’d
set an’ think about it in the shanty an’ then
somebody’d butt in an’ mess up ’is thinkin’.
He’d go ’way off an’ set on the sand by ’isself,
an’ then some geezer’d come snoopin’ ’long an’
chin ’im, an’ ’e couldn’t git no thinkin’ done.</p>

<p>“That cusséd dog o’ Cal’s come ’long the beach
one mornin’. He’s bin runnin’ wild since Cal lit
out. Fer years this whole country’s been fussed
up with ’im an’ ’is doin’s. He died jest as ’e was
pass’n the shanty. We buried ’im up there on
that bluff, an’ that gave Bill an’ me an idea. We
fixed up the place so’s people ’ud think Bill ’ad
faded. Then we humped off down to this bogie
house so Bill could ’ave some peace an’ quiet to
do ’is thinkin’ in. Bill’s invent’n some kind o’
power that’ll make ev’rythin’ hum w’en ’e gits it
finished. It’ll put all them other kinds o’ machines
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
on the blink. That cusséd motor’ll go
’round an’ ’round, an’ she can’t stop ev’ry time
ye bat yer eye at ’er.</p>

<p>“I been bringin’ things down ’ere fer Bill to
eat, an’ sometimes little beasties come ’round the
hut wot ’e shoots. We fixed up that dry brush
so’s nobody ’ud come snoopin’ ’round without
Bill knowin’ it. Him an’ me’s goin’ to divide
wot we make out o’ th’ invention, an’ we’ll ’ave
cash money to burn w’en ’e gits it goin’. We’ll
set in a float’n palace out’n the lake an’ smoke
<i>see</i>gars, with bands on ’em, an’ let the other fellers
do the fishin’, won’t we, Bill?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” responded Saunders. Just then we
heard a sound of breaking sticks outside. Instantly
he seized a long pole that lay along the
side of the wall. It was fitted with a cross-piece
and a round top. Over it was draped various
kinds of thin white fabric. He mounted a box
and pushed the contrivance up through a hole
in the flat roof, moved it up and down, waved
the upper end back and forth a few times, and
withdrew it. He thumped the empty box heavily
with the end of the pole as he took it in, and
picked up about four feet of rusty chain, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
he shook and dragged over the edge of the box
several times.</p>

<p>Through a small chink between the logs we
saw a dim figure moving rapidly away in the
gloom. We heard the crackling of the brush at
the edge of the bluff, and knew that the intruder
had gone.</p>

<p>“That feller’s got the third degree all right,”
remarked Saunders, as he carefully put the ghost
back into its place. “’Tain’t often anybody comes,
but w’en they do they gotta be foiled off. Them
dinnymite signs helps in the daytime, but fer
night we gotta have sump’n else.</p>

<p>“This dress’n’ on the ghost mast come from
Elvirey Smetters. We made up with ’er after
’er wedd’n with Cal busted up an’ Cal skipped.
She was wearin’ most o’ this tackle fer the wedd’n,
an’ she said she didn’t never want to see it ag’in.
There’s a big thin veil fer the top o’ the pole, an’
some o’ the other stuff she said was long-cherry,
er sump’n like that. We keep that hatch battened
down w’en it rains, but she’s loose most o’
the time. W’en I shove the ghost out it pushes it
open.”</p>

<p>Saunders extracted some rye bread, salt pork,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
and cheese from a cupboard. We fried the pork
in a skillet over some embers in the big brick
fire-place, and toasted the cheese. After our
simple meal the old man piled more wood on the
fire, and we smoked and talked until quite late.</p>

<p>The mechanism, on which Saunders was spending
his days of seclusion, reposed under some
tattered canvas near the wall. He was reticent
concerning it, but Sipes volunteered the information
that “they was some little wood’n balls wot
went up an’ down in some tubes that was filled
with oil, an’ then they rolled ’round inside of a
wheel an’ come back.”</p>

<p>“Now you shut up!” commanded Saunders.
“You leave this thing to me ’til I git it done, an’
then you c’n talk ’til yer hat’s wore out. They
ain’t no use talkin’ ’til we git somew’eres, an’ then
we won’t ’ave to talk. Wait ’til I git some little
springs that’ll spread out quick an’ come back
slow, an’ we’ll be through.”</p>

<p>Saunders’s mind was struggling with the eternal
and alluring problem of perpetual motion. He
was groping blindly for the priceless jewel that
would revolutionize the world of mechanics.</p>

<p>It was after midnight when we bade him good-by,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and departed through the moonlit woods for
the beach.</p>

<p>We left the old man in the company of his fire,
and is there greater companionship? It is in our
fires that we find the realm of reverie. The
fecund world of fancy reveals its fair fields and
rose-tinted clouds in the vistas of shimmering
light. Memory brings forth pages that the years
have blurred. Fleeting filaments of faces wondrous
fair, that long ago faded into the mists, smile
wistfully, in halos of tremulous hues, and vanish.
Slow-moving figures, crowned with wreaths of
gray, sometimes linger, turn with looks of tender
mother love, and dissolve in the curling smoke.
The years that have slumbered in the old logs
come forth at the touch of a familiar wand, and
a soft light illumines chambers that time has
sealed. The grim realities are lost in the glow of
our hearth. In the dreamland of the fire we
may ride noble steeds and soar on tireless pinions.
We see heroes fight and fall. Cities with gilded
walls and bright towers, broad landscapes, enthralling
beauty, leaves of laurel on triumphant
brows, majestic pageants, and acclaiming multitudes,
are pictured in the flickering flames.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>On the little stage under the arch of the fireplace
the puppets come and go,&mdash;the comedies
and the tragedies, the laughter and the sorrow.
The dramas of hopes and fears are enacted in shifting
pantomimes that melt away into the gloom.</p>

<p>Our hearth-stones are the symbols of home.
We go forth to battle when their sanctity is imperilled.
It would be a desolate world without
our fires. Winding highways lead through them
on which he who travels must mark the light and
not the ruin. He must feel the glow and not the
burning, and be far beyond the ashes when they
come.</p>

<p>In the twilight, when our lives become gray,
and only the embers lie before us, we can still
dream, if our souls are strong. If we have learned
to live with the ideals we have created, instead of
charred hopes, golden visions may linger in the
mellow light. Happy hours, as transient as the
fitful flames, may dance again, and shine among
the smouldering coals.</p>

<p>The grizzled old sailor, who had been fortune’s
toy, and had been cast aside, may have found his
solace in the visions before his fire. The pictures
in it may have been of millions of wheels turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
with the new force, myriads of aëroplanes soaring
through the skies, dynamos of inexhaustible power
giving heat and light, and countless looms spinning
the fabrics of the world.</p>

<p>He may have seen himself worshipped, not for
his achievement, but for his wealth, in the domain
of Vulgaria, where Avarice is king&mdash;where worth
is measured by dollars&mdash;where utter selfishness
rules, and the cave man still dwells, veneered with
a gilded tinsel of what, in his foolish pride, he
thinks is civilization&mdash;where vanity parades in
the guise of charity&mdash;where cruelty and greed
hide under fine raiment&mdash;where human hyenas
rend the weak and grovel before the strong&mdash;where
the bestiality of the Hun darkens the
world&mdash;where the only god is Gold, and where
the idealist must fight or perish.</p>

<p>One night during the following spring I passed
the cabin. The little structure, from which a
great light might have radiated over the scientific
world, was deserted. A pale, ghostly gleam was
visible through the empty window frame. It
might have been a phosphorescent glow from one
of the decaying wall-logs, or a faint spark from the
dream-fire that ever burns in the hearts of men.

THE WINDING RIVER’S TREASURE</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">There</span> was much bustle and preparation
around the fish shanty one August morning.
Hoarded on a shelf of the bluff were
a lot of water-worn boards, which had drifted in
along the beach at various times, or been thrown
up by the storms, and gradually gathered.</p>

<p>The old shipmates had selected suitable pieces
from the pile, and were busily engaged, with hammer
and saw, in building a cabin on the big boat.
It was a cumbrous and unwieldy craft, about
twenty feet long, with high sides and a broad
beam. For years it had been used in the work of
installing the pound- and gill-nets in the lake, and
for the necessary visits to them when the surf
was too high for the small row-boat, which was
kept for ordinary use.</p>

<p>The long oars, with which Sipes and Saunders
had so often fought the big waves, were not exactly
mated, but when the detachable motor on
the wide stern failed to run, navigation was still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
possible. A bowsprit had been added to the boat,
and a mast protruded through the partially completed
cabin. Many rusty nails and odd pieces
entered into the building of the superstructure.
A large square of soiled canvas and some miscellaneous
cordage lay scattered about on the sand.
Some scrawled lettering in red paint across the
stern indicated that the boat was henceforth to
be the <i>Crawfish</i>.</p>

<p>“We’r’ goin’ on a v’yage,” explained Sipes.
“We’r’ goin’ ’way off up the lake, an’ we’ll touch
at diff’nt ports fer some stores we gotta have, an’
then we’r’ comin’ back, an’ we’r’ goin’ to a cert’n
river you know ’bout, an’ we’r’ goin’ up it. If
you want to make pitchers, you c’n come ’long.
We’ll stop an’ take you aboard w’en we come by
with the stuff we gotta git.”</p>

<p>I had learned from experience that Sipes
usually became reticent when questioned too
closely. It was better to let him volunteer whatever
he wanted to say about his own affairs. I
was careful not to evince any curiosity as to the
object of the river trip, and gladly accepted the
invitation, as I had intended visiting the river
during the fall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>The shanty was stripped of most of its small
movable contents, which were put on board when
the additions were completed. The nets were
taken into the house and piled up. The small
boat was laid on top of them along the wall, and
the door fastened with a rusty padlock.</p>

<p>Sipes remarked, as he put the key in his pocket,
that “they was always some bulgarious feller
rubber’n round fer sump’n light an’ easy, that
’ud clean out that shanty if it wasn’t batt’n’d up
an’ locked.”</p>

<p>The reincarnated craft was floated, and it
sailed slowly away, with the doughty mariners
giving boisterous orders to each other.</p>

<p>A week later I heard a loud halloo, and cries
of “Wot Oh!” down on the beach opposite to my
camp in the dunes. I looked over the edge of
the bluff and saw the <i>Crawfish</i> riding proudly on
the low swells. The broad sail flapped idly in the
breeze, and Saunders was ensconced on top of the
cabin, smoking his pipe. Sipes had waded ashore
and was waiting to help get my belongings on board.</p>

<p>A small tent, a supply of canned goods, sketching
materials, a camera, and other items were
carefully stowed. My row-boat was connected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
with a line, and we were ready to start. We had
only about fifteen miles to go, and expected to
reach the mouth of the river about noon.</p>

<p>The cabin was characteristic of its builders. It
was intended for use and not as an ornament.
Ordinarily two could sleep in it comfortably, but
the present cargo taxed its capacity. There was
little ventilation when the door was closed. What
fresh air there was entered through a pair of
auger holes, which had evidently been bored for
observation purposes. I suggested that the air
inside would be better if the holes were larger,
or if there were more of them, but Sipes claimed
that they were large enough.</p>

<p>“Air c’n come in now faster’n you c’n breath
it. Jest notice how much bigger them holes is
than them in yer nose.” Such logic was uncombatable
and the subject was changed.</p>

<p>The motor worked spasmodically and we sailed
most of the way. The breeze died down when we
were about half a mile from where the Winding
River came out of the dunes. After much cranking
the motor started, but would only run backwards.
We turned the stern toward the river’s
mouth and made fair progress.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>“That’s w’y we named ’er the <i>Crawfish</i>,” explained
Sipes. “We know’d we’d ’ave to do a
lot o’ that kind o’ navigat’n’.”</p>

<p>We ran on to a small sand-bar, which delayed
us for some time, but got off with the oars. After
a hard row against the current, we entered the
mouth of the river, which was not over fifty yards
wide. We heard the sound of music from among
the decayed ruins of a pier that extended into the
lake. Seated on some chunks of broken limestone,
between the rotting piles, we saw a gray-haired
colored man of about sixty. He was playing
“Money Musk” on a mouth organ. Near him
a cane fish-pole was stuck in among the rocks,
and extended out over the water. He was whiling
away the time between bites with his music.</p>

<p>“I bet that feller ain’t no nigro,” remarked
Sipes. “He looks like a white man wot’s been
smoked.”</p>

<p>The solitary fisherman regarded us with an
expectant look, as we tied up to one of the piles.</p>

<p>“Good mawnin’, gen’lemen! Does you-all
happ’n to have sump’n to drink in yo’ boat?”</p>

<p>“We ain’t got nothin’ wet but wot’s leaked in.
You c’n ’ave some o’ that if you want it,” Sipes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
replied with some asperity. “Wot’s the matter
with the lake if you’r’ thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Ah beg yo’ pa’don, but you-all looked like
gen’lemen that might have sump’n with you.
This ain’t thirst. Ah got a misery, an’ it ’curred
to me you might like to save ma life. Ah ain’t
had no breakfus’, an Ah feels weak.”</p>

<p>“Listen at that smoke,” said Sipes, in an undertone.
“Wonder if ’e thinks we’r’ a float’n’ s’loon?”</p>

<p>Evidently discouraged over his prospects with
Sipes, the old darky turned to me.</p>

<p>“Say, Boss, will you gimme a qua’tah, so Ah
c’n go an’ git some breakfus’?”</p>

<p>We thought it better to give him some “breakfus’”
from the boat, and, as it was lunch time, we
passed part of our eatables over to him.</p>

<p>“Ah nevah had the pleas’ah of meet’n you
gen’lemen befo’. Ma name’s Na’cissus Jackson,
an’ Ah’m up heah f’om the south. Ah ce’t’nly
am ’bliged to you fo’ this li’l breakfus’.”</p>

<p>We talked with Narcissus for some time. Evidently
he was a victim of strong drink. He had
drifted into prohibition territory, the extent of
which he did not know, and out of which he had
no financial means of escape.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>“Ah’m on a dry island, Boss, an’ Ah don’t
know how Ah’m goin’ to git off it. Ah was cook
at the place wheah Ah wo’ked, an’ Ah got fiahed
just ’cause Ah didn’t show up one mawnin’. They
was goin’ to have me ’rested fo’ sump’n Ah didn’t
have nuff’n to do with, an’ Ah come heah fo’ a
li’l vacation.”</p>

<p>Sipes suggested that we ought to have a pilot
to take us up the river, on account of its many
sand-bars, that must have shifted since he was
on it after ducks years ago.</p>

<p>“We oughta have somebody sett’n on top o’
the cab’n to yell out, an’ keep us from butt’n into
sump’n w’en we’r’ tear’n up stream. This ain’t
no canoe, an’ we got import’nt business an’ we
don’t want to git stuck,” declared the old man.</p>

<p>“Theah’s a man ovah in the village named
Cap’n Peppehs, that knows all about this rivah,”
replied Narcissus. “S’pos’n you-all gimme a
qua’tah, an’ Ah’ll go up an’ git Cap’n Peppehs
fo’ you.”</p>

<p>I agreed to furnish the coveted coin if “Cap’n
Peppehs” was produced, and our new-found friend
took in his pole, climbed out over the rough stone
filling, and departed for the village, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
only a short distance off. He soon reappeared,
accompanied by a pompous, deep-voiced old man,
with a red nose and scraggly whiskers, who looked
us over with curiosity.</p>

<p>“My name’s Peppers. What can I do for you?”
he asked in a friendly tone.</p>

<p>“We’r’ goin’ up the river an’ we don’t want to
git messed up on no sand-bars,” replied Saunders.
“If you been navigat’n’ these waters, we’d like to
git you to go ’long ’til we git where we want to go.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll drop me off back o’ the third bend,
I’ll git aboard,” said the old man. “You won’t
need no pilot after that. You c’n go on up an’
not hit anythin’ but float’n snags beyond that fer
three miles in that craft.”</p>

<p>He got into the boat. I handed Narcissus his
“qua’tah,” and he picked his way back over the
rocks to his fish-pole, where, like his fabled namesake,
he may have found solace in the contemplation
of his image in the placid water.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Peppehs” examined the motor with
interest. “Are you goin’ to run ’er up with
that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, if she’ll go,” replied Saunders, “but I
bet she won’t. A friend of ours that peddles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
fish got it some’r’s ’round ’ere, an’ turned it over
to us. If we ever cetch the feller that shifted that
cusséd thing onto John, we’r’ goin’ to kill ’im.
We got a gun in the cab’n wot’s wait’n’ fer ’im.”</p>

<p>“I know sump’n ’bout them things,” said the
Captain, “an’ mebbe I c’n start ’er.” He fussed
over the machine for some time, and finally got it
going. With the help of the oars we made fair
progress against the slow current.</p>

<p>“You c’n go on up now an’ camp in that bunch
o’ timber beyond the marsh, an’ you’ll be all
right,” said the old man, when we reached the
point where he was to leave us. “You’ll find a
mighty fine spring up there.”</p>

<p>We thanked him warmly for his services. Sipes
proffered the hospitality of a two-gallon jug,
which he extracted from the pile of stuff in the
cabin. It was eagerly accepted. He wished us
good luck, and disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’ll make ’is nose bloom some more,” remarked
Sipes. “He’s a nice ol’ feller, but wot’s
springs to him? It wasn’t no green peppers ’e
was named after.”</p>

<p>The river made many turns in its sinuous course
through the marsh, and it was nearly dark when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
we reached a hard bank at the edge of the
woods.</p>

<p>The <i>Crawfish</i> was made fast to a venerable elm,
and we went ashore.</p>

<p>“I’ll put a couple o’ extra hitches on ’er so she
can’t back off in the night, if the gas bug takes a
notion to git busy,” said Saunders, as he took
another line ashore from the stern.</p>

<p>It was warm and pleasant, and we decided that
no shelter would be necessary that night. We
built a small fire against the side of a log, fried some
bacon in a skillet, made coffee, and fared well, if
not sumptuously, with supplies from the boat.</p>

<p>We sat around and talked until quite late.
The object of the expedition was revealed by
Saunders.</p>

<p>“They was a feller that come to the bogie-house
one night w’en they was a big storm that ’ad
come up sudd’n. He’d come from the lake, an’
it was blowin’ so hard that it ’ud take hair off a
frog. He’d started on a long trip with a little
boat. He had one o’ them cusséd motors like wot
we got, an’ it went punk, an’ ’e had an awful time
git’n’ in alive. He seen my light an’ come up. I
didn’t ’ear ’im til ’e knocked, so I didn’t ’ave no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
chance to spring the ghost on ’im. W’en I seen
the mess ’e was in, I took ’im in an’ fed ’im an’
dried ’im out ’fore the fire.</p>

<p>“He seemed to be a scientific feller, an’ ’e told
me a lot about the rivers all over the country.
He said that durin’ the fall ’is business was to go
’round an’ buy pearls wot fishers got out o’ them
fresh-water clams that’s all over the bottoms o’
the rivers. He’d pay ’em good prices. He said
the pearls ’ad thin layers on ’em, like onions, an’
sometimes one would look like it was no good.
Then ’e’d take a steel thing an’ peel off the outside
skin, an’ sometimes ’e’d git one that way
that was wuth five hundred dollars. Then ’e
said they was button companies that ’ud buy all
the shells o’ the clams, so they was a lot o’ money
in it, even if they wasn’t no pearls found. He
had a little pearl in ’is pocket that ’e’d peeled.
It wasn’t a very good one&mdash;prob’ly wuth three
er four dollars. He gave it to me fer bein’ good
to ’im, an’ ’ere it is.”</p>

<p>The old sailor carefully unrolled a small piece
of paper, which he took out of his tobacco pouch,
and produced the pearl.</p>

<p>“This feller gimme a little book that didn’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
’ave no cover on, that’s sent out by the gov’ment,
an’ it tells all about clam fish’n’, an’ how to make
drag-hooks, an’ how to rig ’em, an’ drag ’em, an’
all about it.”</p>

<p>He brought out the interesting pamphlet, with
the address of the giver written in pencil on one
of the margins.</p>

<p>“The next mornin’ I helped the feller put wot
was left o’ his boat an’ motor up in the bogie-house,
an’ ’e went off through the woods. He
said ’e’d come back some day an’ git ’em.</p>

<p>“Invent’n’s no good. We gotta git sump’n we
c’n git a big bunch o’ money out of. Fish’n’s
git’n’ to be too hard work fer us. They’s slews o’
wealth in this water, an’ we’r’ goin’ to git it out an’
we won’t ’ave to work no more. We didn’t say
nothin’ to nobody. John come ’round an’ we told
’im, but ’e’s all right. This whole thing’s a dark
secret. It’s all right fer you to know, but we
gotta keep still, er the place’ll be full o’ flatboats
an’ the pearls’ll be gone. Sipes an’ me’s seen
where the mushrats ’as been pilin’ the shells
’round them little places where they got holes in
the banks, an’ out’n the marsh where their houses
are, w’en we was down ’ere duck-shoot’n’. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
them little beasties c’n git ’em, we c’n mop out
the whole river with all that tackle that the book
tells about.”</p>

<p>“The fust thing we gotta do, after we git a
flatboat built, is to git some heavy wire fer them
clam drags,” said Sipes. “We c’n go back to the
railroad an’ git some out between them telegraph
poles. The wire don’t cost them fellers nothin’,
an’ it’s better we should ’ave it. Tomorrer we’ll
rig up a reg’lar camp, an’ then we’ll go to work
on all the things we gotta git ready so we c’n
begin devastat’n them clamsies.”</p>

<p>The old man then went over to the boat for
the jug. He set it down and began working the
cork out with his knife.</p>

<p>“I don’t do much drink’n’, but me an’ Bill’s
git’n’ old, an’ we’r’ in a my-larious country, an’
we gotta have grog once an’ aw’ile.”</p>

<p>Just as the cork came out, we heard a rustle of
dead leaves on the ground back of us.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, gen’lemen!” greeted Narcissus
Jackson, as he appeared out of the darkness, and
walked deferentially up to the fire. “Fine evenin’,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“You <i>bet</i> it’s a fine evenin’!” exclaimed Sipes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
with freezing politeness. “How fur off did you
smell this jug from?”</p>

<p>“Ah just thought Ah’d drop ’round an’ see how
you gen’lemen was get’n’ ’long. Ah come up in
a li’l boat I got offen Cap’n Peppehs. Ah saw
yo’ fiah, an’ Ah just come to pay ma respec’s.
Is you-all well an’ puffec’ly comfo’ble up heah?
How’s you feel’n’, Mr. Sipes? Seem’s like you
had a li’l cold this mawnin’.”</p>

<p>“I’m better, but ‘Ah feels weak,’” quoted
Sipes, with biting sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Ah ce’t’nly am glad to heah yo’ voice again,”
continued Narcissus. “It’s a long tia’some row up
heah, an Ah ce’t’nly am glad to find you gen’lemen
all sit’n’ so comfo’ble ’round yo’ li’l fiah.”</p>

<p>The veiled appeal was irresistible. Sipes handed
over the jug and cup, after he and Saunders had
been “refreshed,” and he had pitied my teetotalism
with a patronizing glance.</p>

<p>“That’s a <i>nice</i> li’l tin cup, an’ that’s an awful
pretty shaped jug,” observed our unexpected visitor,
as he affectionately watched the red liquid
trickle out. “Pa’don me, but Ah always closes
ma eyes when Ah take ma li’l drink, ’cause if
Ah don’t, ma mouth watahs so it weak’ns ma
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
whiskey.” The contents of the cup instantly
vanished.</p>

<p>We were about ready to make our arrangements
for the night when Narcissus appeared. Fortunately
my own supplies included a lot of mosquito
netting. I got it out and he promptly offered to
help. He deftly improvised an effective covering
with the netting and some sticks that excited the
admiration of all of us.</p>

<p>“If you’d git toughed up, an’ raise a face o’
whiskers, them skeets wouldn’t chase after you,”
observed Sipes.</p>

<p>Narcissus sat on a log and did not seem inclined
to go away.</p>

<p>“Say, Boss, will you lemme have a qua’tah
to get ma breakfus’ with in the mawnin’?” he
asked humbly.</p>

<p>The request was cheerfully complied with. I
really liked Narcissus. His interesting face,
winning personality, and happy-go-lucky ways
appealed to my sense of the picturesque. It occurred
to me that if the jug could be eliminated
from the situation, he would be a valuable addition
to the camp. I invited him to stay all night
and have breakfast with us in the morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>When Sipes heard the invitation accepted, he
went down to the boat to satisfy himself that
Saunders had locked the door when he had returned
the jug to the cabin.</p>

<p>In the morning Narcissus volunteered to prepare
our simple breakfast. He did it with such
skill that we realized that our own cooking was
crude and amateurish.</p>

<p>During the forenoon I had a long talk with him.
He was stranded and would like to stay with us
if we were willing. For a moderate stipend he
agreed to do the cooking and make himself generally
useful.</p>

<p>I did not wish to intrude too much on the old
shipmates, and, as I wanted to be alone much of
the time, and do some sketching along the river,
I established my camp about a hundred yards
further up on the same side of the stream. This
I judged to be near enough for sociability, and
far enough for privacy. Narcissus helped erect
my tent, and made many ingenious arrangements
for my work and comfort.</p>

<p>The old sailors became so enthusiastic over his
cooking that they were glad to have him down
with them most of the time. The sail had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
taken off the boat, and a “lean-to” tent rigged
between two trees, where they all slept.</p>

<p>“You jest watch that cookie coin pancakes!”
exclaimed Sipes. “He jest whisks up the dope
in the pan, an’ gives ’em a couple o’ flops, an’
they all come to pieces in yer mouth ’fore ye
begin chewin’.”</p>

<p>He seemed to anticipate all our wants. He had
evidently overheard what Sipes had said about
telegraph wire, and the second morning afterward
there was about a hundred feet of it in
camp, with a pair of heavy wire-nippers, and
other tools used by repair men on the lines, which
he said he had found. The next night he came in
with a half-grown turkey, which he claimed he
had found dead in a fence, where it had caught
its neck on the barbed wire. The unfortunate
bird was roasted to a beautiful brown, and I
noticed that the feathers were carefully burned.</p>

<p>The aspect of affairs was getting serious. I
took Narcissus in hand and subjected him to a
thorough cross-examination. I told him that we
wanted to pay for anything we used, and that he
positively must not find any more young turkeys
in wire fences. The telegraph wire incident was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
perplexing. He declared that this stuff had been
abandoned, and was far from the railroad. The
fact that the tools and wire were somewhat rusty
seemed to lend some slight color of truth to his
statement, but we finally understood each other
as to the rule to be followed in the future.</p>

<p>A cash allowance was made for the fresh vegetables,
eggs, fruit, and other supplies, which he
was instructed to buy around in the back country
and along the river. I hoped later to discover
the owner of the ill-fated turkey.</p>

<p>The old shipmates worked industriously. They
took the <i>Crawfish</i> down the river to the village
twice, and returned with cargos of second-hand
lumber, with which they constructed a flatboat
about ten feet long by six wide. Supports were
put at the four corners, and railings nailed to the
tops. They rigged a strong pole, the length of
the platform, along which they attached four-foot
wires eight inches apart. At the ends of these
were the four-pronged clam-hooks. Lines ran
from the ends of the pole to a centre rope, by
means of which the device was attached to the
flatboat and dragged in the river. When the
hooks came in contact with the unsuspecting mollusks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
lying open on the bottom, they were to
close their shells on them tightly, and thus their
fate would be sealed. When the pole was pulled
out sideways, with the big rope, the bivalves
would hang on its fringe of dangling wires, like
grapes on pendant vines.</p>

<p>Our “cookie” was assiduous in his camp duties.
He procured some flat stones, which he skilfully
piled so as to confine his fire. Heavy stakes were
driven into the ground, and another laid across,
with its ends in the forked tops. The cross-piece
supported the iron kettle, with which he performed
mysterious feats of cookery. He improvised
a broiler with some of the telegraph
wire, and baked delicious bread and biscuits in
a reflecting oven, made of a piece of old sheet-iron.
He was very resourceful. From somewhere
beyond the confines of the dark forest he obtained
materials for menus that exceeded our fondest
hopes.</p>

<p>He spent a great deal of time off by himself,
and would often drop around where I happened
to be sketching. We had many confidential talks.
He confessed that drink was his besetting sin.
He had generally been able to get good jobs, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
invariably lost them when he drank. Some day
he was “goin’ to sweah off fo’ good.” The poor
fellow was floating wreckage on that poison stream
of alcohol that our false conception of economics
permits to exist. It was battering another derelict
along the rocks that line its sinister shores.</p>

<p>He had attached himself to us like a stray dog.
His moral sense had been blunted by his infirmity,
but, under proper influences, his reclamation was
possible. Narcissus was a strong argument in
favor of compulsory prohibition, for he was beyond
his own help.</p>

<p>The old shipmates agreed with me that he
ought to be kept away from temptation as much
as possible, “spesh’ly,” said Sipes, “as we ain’t
got none too much in the jug. It ain’t fit fer nobody
that’s under sixty-seven. Young fellers
oughta let that stuff alone. They git filled up
with it an’ it runs down in their legs an’ floats
their feet off.”</p>

<p>Narcissus’s ancestry was mixed. He had some
white blood, and one of his grandfathers was an
Indian. Though the African characteristics predominated,
there were traces of both the white
man and the Indian in his face. It may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
been a remnant of Indian instinct&mdash;a mysterious
call of the blood&mdash;that lured him to the
dune country, where the red men were once
happy, when he got into trouble. Possibly it
was the sixth sense of the Indian that led him
up the river to the jug, on the night of our arrival,
or, as Sipes remarked, “mebbe the perfumery got
out through the cork an’ drifted over ’im w’en ’e
was roostin’ on them rocks.”</p>

<p>He cooked some carp, which he had caught in
the river, and was much disappointed when we
found them unpalatable. The following evening
he compounded a delicious sauce, with which he
camouflaged the despised fish almost beyond recognition,
but their identity was unmistakable.
Sipes declared that “the dope on them carps is
fine, but I don’t like wot it’s mixed with.” He
ate the sauce and threw his piece of fish out among
the trees. The next morning he saw a crow drop
down and eat it.</p>

<p>“That ol’ bird’s been through enough to know
better’n that,” he remarked.</p>

<p>The fish that came to us from the land of the
Hun, and now infests our inland waters, has
little to commend it. It is objectionable wherever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
it exists. It breeds immoderately, eats the spawn
of respectable fish, and begrimes the pure waters
with its hog-like rooting along the weedy bottoms.
It is of inferior food value and pernicious. No
means of exterminating these noxious aliens have
been discovered. Like the Huns, they have all
of the instincts of marauding swine, without their
redeeming qualities.</p>

<p>“These heah cahp ah funny fish,” said Narcissus.
“A gen’leman tol’ me a few yeahs ago of a
cahp that was caught in the Mississippi rivah
that was ve’y la’ge. They opened ’im an’ found
a gold watch an’ chain that ’e’d swallowed, an’
the watch was tickin’ when they took it out, an’
theah was a cha’m on the chain, an’ inside the
cha’m was a li’l pict’ah of a young lady. The
young man that caught the cahp found that
young lady an’ theah was a wedd’n. Of co’se
Ah didn’t see the watch, er the young man, but
that was the tale Ah hea’d. Theah’s been some
awful wonde’ful things happened down on that
Mississippi rivah.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! if them Dutch fish ’ave got timepieces in
’em, mebbe we better pursue ’em instid o’ clams,”
remarked Sipes. “Them carps c’n live on land
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
pretty near as well as they do in water. They’r’
like mudturkles. Bill an’ me seen a big one once’t,
that was in a little puddle on some land that ’ad
been flowed over. We thought prob’ly the water’d
gone down an’ left ’im stranded. His back stuck
out o’ the puddle an’ was all dry an’ caked with
mud. Mebbe he’d been out devastat’n’ the country
fer watches an’ jools, er sump’n, in the night,
an’ ’ad jest stopped at that hole fer a little rest
on ’is way back.”</p>

<p>We spent many interesting evenings around the
old shipmates’ camp fire. Sipes and Saunders
related marvellous tales of the sea. Narcissus
told many ornate yarns that he had picked up
during his checkered life, and sang negro revival
songs and plantation melodies. The bleached
skeleton of some animal in the woods had provided
him with material for two pairs of “bones,”
with which he was an adept. His mouth organ
was a source of much entertainment. Sipes’s
favorite was “Money Musk,” the merry jingle
that came over the water when we entered the
river, and he often asked Narcissus to “play that
cash-money tune some more.”</p>

<p>When the clam-boat was completed, and fully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
rigged with its paraphernalia, it was pushed out
into the slow current. It was controlled with the
oars from the <i>Crawfish</i>. The pole, with its pendant
wires, was dropped over the side, and actual
operations began. A bench had been erected in
the middle of the rude craft, before which Sipes
stood, flourishing a stubby knife, ready to open
the mollusks and remove their precious contents.
He had a small red tin tobacco box, with a hinged
cover, which he intended to fill with pearls the
first day.</p>

<p>“Let’s pull ’er up now,” he suggested, after the
flatboat had drifted about a hundred feet downstream.
Saunders lifted in the tackle. Two victims
dangled on the wires.</p>

<p>“Gosh, this is easy! Gimme them clams!”
They were eagerly opened, but careful scrutiny
revealed no pearls. “I guess them damn Dutch
fish ’ave got ’em, like they did that watch Cookie
told about. Heave ’er over an’ we’ll try ’er ag’in,
Bill.”</p>

<p>The first day’s work was fruitless, as were many
that followed. The clam-hooks frequently got
snagged, and seemed to bring up everything but
pearls. Once an angry snapping-turtle was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
thrown back. An enormous catfish, whose meditations
on the bottom had been violently disturbed,
was pulled to the surface, but escaped.</p>

<p>“Mebbe we’ll cetch a billy-goat if this keeps
up,” remarked Sipes.</p>

<p>The old men toiled on with dogged persistence.
One Sunday morning an aged bivalve was pulled
up and a pearl, over three-eighths of an inch in
diameter, fell out on the bench when Sipes’s knife
struck the inside of the shell.</p>

<p>“Hoo-<i>ray</i>!!! Here she is!” he yelled.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, y’ol’ miser! Gimme that,” commanded
Saunders.</p>

<p>He examined it closely and compared it with
the one the wrecked pearl-buyer had given him.</p>

<p>“How much d’ye think that onion-skinner’d
give us fer that?” asked Sipes, anxiously.</p>

<p>“It’s about three times as big, an’ it’s rounder.
It oughta be wuth fifteen er twenty dollars,” replied
Saunders, as he put it with the other specimen
and rolled it up in the soiled paper.</p>

<p>“Here, Bill, you can’t do that! Gimme that
jool. It’s gotta go in the box.” Saunders surrendered
the pearl, and Sipes carefully put it
where it belonged.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>“We ain’t goin’ to fuss with no button companies,
w’en we c’n find them things,” declared
Sipes, as he kicked the pile of empty shells overboard.
“That ain’t no money fer a jool like that.
Wot are you talk’n’ about? You don’t know
nothin’ ’bout pearls. I bet it’s wuth a thousand
dollars right now, an’ mebbe it’ll be wuth two
thousand if we git that feller to peel it. I bet
all them jools has to be peeled.”</p>

<p>That part of the pearl-buyer’s talk with Saunders
that related to the removal of the layers,
and the comparison of a pearl’s structure with
that of an onion, had strongly impressed Sipes,
and he generally referred to him as “the onion-skinner.”</p>

<p>During the rest of the day he shook the box
frequently to assure himself that the pearl was
still there.</p>

<p>Various “slugs,” pearls of irregular shape and
of little value, were found during the next week,
and the increasing spoil was gloated over at
night.</p>

<p>Narcissus was sometimes added to the working
force on the flatboat, which was taken up stream
as far as the depth permitted, for a fresh start.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

<p>“We’r’ goin’ to drag this ol’ river from stem to
gudgeon,” declared Sipes. “W’en we git through
the mushrats’ll have a tough time hustl’n’ fer
food. We’ll git back in the marsh where the big
clams stay in them open places ’mong the splatter-docks,
where all them lily-flowers grow, an’ we’ll
git some jools that it won’t do to drop on yer foot.
I seen a clam in the marsh once’t that was over
eight inches long, an’ I bet ’e was a hundred years
old.”</p>

<p>One night Narcissus tied his little boat to a
tree near the spring. He left some fresh vegetables
in it, which he had procured up the river.
In the morning it was discovered that the boat
had been visited. The unknown caller had eaten
most of the supplies. Fragments were scattered
about, but no tracks were visible. A pile of green
corn and some melons met the same fate a few
nights afterward, and Sipes decided to ambush
the visitor.</p>

<p>He lay on his stomach in the dark, with his
gun beside him, and waited. About midnight he
heard splashing in the shallow water along the
bank, and, a moment later, the dim light revealed
a spotted cow helping herself liberally to the contents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
of the boat. Evidently she had forded the
river somewhere up stream, and had accidentally
found a welcome base of supplies.</p>

<p>“Come ’ere, Spotty!” Sipes called softly, as
he cautiously advanced. The friendly marauder
did not seem at all alarmed, and submitted peacefully
to the coil of anchor rope that was taken
from the bottom of the boat and gently slipped
over her horns. She was led out of the water
and tied to a tree. Sipes procured a tin pail at
the camp, and “Spotty” yielded of her abundance.</p>

<p>There was cream for our coffee the next day.
Spotty was nowhere visible. The old man had
conducted her into the woods and “anchored ’er,”
with a stake and a long rope, in a hidden glade,
where there was plenty of grass.</p>

<p>The following evening we were enjoying our
pipes, while Narcissus was cleaning up after a
delicious dinner. An old man with a heavy hickory
cane hobbled into camp. His unkempt white
beard nearly reached his waist. His shoulders
were bent with age. He appeared to be over
eighty.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ancient!” was Sipes’s cheery greeting,
as the patriarch came up to the fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>“Good evenin’!” responded the visitor.
“How’s the clam fish’n’?”</p>

<p>“Jest so-so,” replied Saunders. “Have a seat.”</p>

<p>He gave the old man a box, with an improvised
back, to sit on, and, after a few remarks about
the weather, our caller explained that he had lost
a cow, and wondered if we had seen anything of
her.</p>

<p>“Wot kind of a look’n’ anamile was she?” inquired
Sipes.</p>

<p>“Gray, with a lot o’ black spots on ’er. One
horn bent out forrads, an’ the other was twisted
back, an’ she had a short tail. She’s been roamin’
in the woods a good deal lately, an’ last night she
didn’t come home. I thought I’d come down this
way an’ see if I could locate ’er.”</p>

<p>“I seen a cow like that yisterd’y,” replied the
culprit. “She was over on the other side o’ the
river, an’ come down to drink. She prob’ly
mosies ’round nights like that ’cause she’s restluss.
Her tail’s bobbed an’ she can’t switch away
the skeets. She’ll prob’ly show up all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I s’pose she will. Guess I won’t worry
about ’er.” The visitor’s eyes wandered about
the camp. I had noticed a small brown turkey
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
feather on the ground, near where Sipes sat, but
that wily strategist had deftly slipped it into his
side pocket.</p>

<p>Evidently the industry on the river had been
duly observed by the scattered dwellers in the
back country, for our caller seemed to know all
about us. He understood that I was “drawin’
scenes ’round ’ere.” Possibly some unknown observer
had, at some time, come near enough to
see what I was doing, and noislessly retreated.</p>

<p>Sipes went down to the cabin of the <i>Crawfish</i>,
and returned with the jug. “Wouldn’t ye like
to ’ave a little sump’n, after yer long walk?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“B’lieve I would!”</p>

<p>“Say w’en,” said Sipes, as he tilted the jug
over the cup.</p>

<p>“Jest a <i>lee</i>tle, not more’n a thimbleful!”</p>

<p>“Some thimbles is bigger’n others,” observed
the old sailor, as he half filled the cup.</p>

<p>While protesting against the liberal offering,
the old man disposed of the “little sump’n” with
much relish.</p>

<p>Narcissus watched the proceedings from behind
his kitchen bench with appealing eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>“How long you been liv’n’ ’round ’ere, Ancient?”
asked Sipes.</p>

<p>“I come here in the fall o’ forty-eight. It was
all open water whar that slough is then. It’s
weeded up sence. We used to chase deer out all
over the ice thar in the winter. They’d slip down
an’ couldn’t git up, an’ we got slews of ’em that
way. In the fall we’d find ’em on the beach ’long
the big lake. We’d shoo ’em out in the water, an’
then stay ’long the shore an’ yell at ’em an’ keep
’em from comin’ in. They’d swim ’round fer a
couple of hours, an’ they’d git so tired the waves
’ud wash ’em in, an’ we’d cetch ’em. We’d lay
up enough meat to last all winter.</p>

<p>“We had to save amminition, fer we had to go
twenty miles to the trading post fer wot we used.
The Injuns was thicker’n hair on a dog ’round ’ere
then. Many’s the time, in the summer, I’ve
looked down the marsh an’ seen ’em set’n’ on the
mushrat houses suckin’ wild duck eggs wot they’d
found ’round in the slough.”</p>

<p>“I bet them was big pearls wot they was munchin’
on,” observed Sipes.</p>

<p>Not noticing the interruption the Ancient continued.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>“They was so many wild ducks an’ geese ’round
’ere in the fall, that you didn’t ’ave to shoot ’em
at all. You c’d go down on that sand-spit whar
the river runs out o’ the marsh, jest ’fore daylight,
w’en they was comin’ out, an’ knock ’em down
with a stick. They’d fly so low, an’ they was so
thick you couldn’t miss ’em, an’ you c’d git all
you c’d carry.”</p>

<p>“Gosh! Let’s give ’im another drink!” whispered
Sipes.</p>

<p>“Them days is all gone. Sometimes you see
ducks hereabouts, but the sky’s never black with
’em like it used to be. Thar was millions o’ wild
pigeons ’ere too. They’d set on the dead trees so
thick that the branches busted off, an’ thar was
eagles ’ere that used to fly off with the young
pigs, an’ I’ve killed rattlesnakes over in the hills
as thick as yer arm, an’ eight feet long, but they’ve
been gone fer years.</p>

<p>“Thar was tall pine all through this country
then, but it’s been cut out. Pretty near ev’ry
mile ’long the big lake thar’s old piles stick’n’ up.
Them was piers that the logs was hauled to with
oxen an’ bob-sleds. The logs was loaded from
the piers onto schooners that carried ’em off on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
the lake. I used to work at the loggin’ in the
winter.</p>

<p>“Ev’ry now an’ then we’d git a b’ar, an’ we
used to find lots o’ wild honey. The wolves used
to chase us w’en they was in packs, but w’en one
was alone ’e’d always run. Thar’s been some
awful big fires through ’ere. Once it was all burnt
over fer fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“That ol’ mossback knows a lot, don’t ’e?”
whispered Sipes to me, as the narrator paused
to light his pipe.</p>

<p>“Them pearls you fellers er fish’n’ fer reminds
me of a story. Thar was a lot o’ Injuns lived ’ere
at this end o’ the marsh long about sixty-three.
Thar was an’ ol’ medicine-man that ’ad gathered
about a peck o’ them things, big an’ little, an’
kep’ ’em in a skin bag. Thar was a bad Injun
’ere named Tom Skunk, an’ ’e stole ev’rything
’e c’d lay ’is hands on. He didn’t know the bag
had much value, but ’e carried it off one day
w’en the old man was gone. The Injuns got so
mad ’bout all the meat an’ skins this feller kep’
takin’ that they fixed it up to drill ’im out o’
the country. They caught ’im an’ made ’im give
the ol’ Injun back ’is bag. Then they told ’im
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
to vamoose. He stuck ’round fer a few days,
an’ one night ’e paddled down the river in ’is
canoe. The ol’ Injun was pretty mad. He peeked
out of ’is wigwam an’ seen ’im comin’. He got
’is ol’ smooth-bore rifle out an’ rammed a handful
o’ them little pearls on top o’ the powder. [Groan
from Sipes.] W’en Tom Skunk come by ’e let
loose an’ filled ’im full of ’em. Tom got away
somehow, an’ that was the last seen of ’im in these
parts. We heard afterward that ’e went to a
govament post, an’ the surgeon spent a week
pick’n’ out the pearls an’ sold ’em fer a big price.</p>

<p>“We used to have snapp’n’ turtles in this river
that was two feet across, an’ they’d come out in
the night after the hens. We cut the head off o’
one once, an’ ’e lived a week after that. He had
a date, seventeen hundred and sump’n, on ’is
back. He was all caked up with moss an’ crusted
shell, so we couldn’t quite make out the year.
Somebody must ’a’ burnt it on with a hot iron.</p>

<p>“All the ol’ settlers in these parts are dead now,
’ceptin’ me, an’ I’m git’n’ pretty feeble, an’ don’t
git ’round like I used to. I’m eighty-four an’,
damn ’em, I’ve buried ’em all!”</p>

<p>He reached for his hickory cane and rose painfully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>“I guess I gotta be goin’ ’long now, fer it’s git’n’
late. If you see anything o’ my cow, I wish you’d
let me know.”</p>

<p>We loaned him a lantern and bade him good-night,
as he limped away through the woods.</p>

<p>After the departure of our entertaining visitor,
we took Sipes to task about the cow. Under
gentle pressure, he reluctantly agreed to release
the animal, and left for the glade, where Spotty
was secreted. I noticed that he took a pail with
him.</p>

<p>Spotty visited the camp several times during
the next week, and the menus were enriched with
dishes that would have been otherwise impossible.
I suggested that something ought to be done for
the Ancient to even things up.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sipes, “we’ll have Cookie take
’im up a big bunch o’ carps, so ’e c’n ’av’ some fish.
Gosh! We gotta have milk.”</p>

<p>By the use of delicate diplomacy and confidential
explanation, I amicably adjusted the milk
difficulty with Spotty’s owner, and arranged that
the faithful animal should furnish us with two
quarts a day. The old settler was very tolerant
and reasonable, and I had no trouble about the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
matter at all. He often came to see us, and
brought welcome additions to our food supplies.</p>

<p>The golden fall days and the cool nights came.
The pearl hunting and the genial gatherings at
the camp fire continued. The destruction of the
unios in the river went on with unabated zeal.
Many hundreds of them were opened and thrown
away. Man, the wisest, and yet the most ignorant
of living creatures, lays waste the land of
plenty that prodigal nature has spread before him.</p>

<p>The tin box was nearly full of specimens, varying
in size, shape, and color. The attrition which
Sipes caused by frequently shaking the box
dulled the lustre on many of the pearls. Saunders
discovered the damage, and afterwards they
were properly protected. He suggested that we
get a baby-rattle and a rubber teething ring for
Sipes, so he would not “have to amoose ’imself
shakin’ the shine offen them pearls.”</p>

<p>The dauntless toilers refused to be driven in
by unfavorable weather. One morning dawned
with a cold drizzly rain, but it was the day of
days on the flatboat.</p>

<p>“Whoop! Whoop! Holy jumpin’ wild-cats!”
shrieked Sipes, hysterically.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<p>A resplendent oval form, as large as a filbert,
iridescent with subtle light and flashing hues of
rose and green, rolled out of a bivalve which he had
partially opened. Its satiny sheen gleamed softly
in the palm of the old man’s gnarled and dirty
hand&mdash;a pearl that might glow on the bosom of
a houri, or mingle in the splendor of a diadem.</p>

<p>“Avast there, you ol’ money-bags! You’ll
founder the ship!” yelled Saunders, as they
danced with delirious joy in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>Work was suspended for the day. The prize
was proudly and tenderly carried to camp, with
great rejoicing.</p>

<p>“Come ’ere, you Jack o’ Clubs, an’ see wot a
million dollars looks like!” shouted Sipes to Narcissus,
who was hurrying to meet them.</p>

<p>Saunders told me, when we met that night,
that “Cookie’s eyes stuck out like grapes, an’
you c’d ’a’ brushed ’em off with a stick w’en ’e
seen wot we had.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately the jug was much in evidence.
Narcissus responded many times to Sipes’s insistent
demands for “that cash-money tune.”
The old shipmates danced in the flickering firelight.
Vociferous songs awoke the echoes in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
surrounding gloom of the damp forest. The big
pearl was repeatedly examined, and much speculation
was indulged in as to its value, which was
considered almost fabulous. The hilarity extended
far into the night, until the revellers fell
asleep from sheer exhaustion. The jug was left
on the grass, and Narcissus fondled it between
drinks, while the magnates slumbered.</p>

<p>“It’s only the rich an’ fuzzy that enjoys this
life,” observed Sipes with a prolonged yawn,
when I came over and woke him in the morning.
“Think o’ them val’able clams wot sleeps out
there in the bottom o’ the river. The little runts
can’t swim ’round, an’ they can’t chase food.
They ’ave to take wot’s fed ’em by the current.
They can’t smoke ’er talk, an’ they can’t ’ave
nothin’ but water to drink. They jest lay there
an’ make them little jools fer me an’ Bill. That
big feller’d prob’ly been wait’n’ fer us all summer
to come ’long an’ save ’im from them mushrats.”</p>

<p>The happy old sailor’s remarks suggested the
thought that most of the great intellectual pearls
in the world have come from the minds of those
who have pondered long in silent and secluded
places.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“Hi there, Bill, you ol’ lobster, wake up. I
want some breakfast. Where’s that cusséd
cookie?” he demanded.</p>

<p>We found poor Narcissus reclining against a
tree&mdash;a pitiful picture. The jug sat near him.
The cup, mouth organ, and his tattered cap were
lying about on the grass. A primitive human
animal had found satiety in what he craved.</p>

<p>“Gosh! Look at that id’jut!” exclaimed Sipes,
as he picked up the jug. “They was two gallons
in ’ere w’en we started out, an’ they was about
two quarts last night. This soak’s spilt it all into
’im ’cept about a pint, an’ we gotta save it fer
snake-bites.”</p>

<p>“Say, Boss, lemme off!” pleaded the culprit,
weakly. In his confused brain there was a sense
of trouble that he could not quite comprehend.</p>

<p>We got our own breakfast. Narcissus watched
us helplessly from under his tree. He appeared
quite sick.</p>

<p>“That cookie’s blue ’round the gills,” remarked
Sipes. “He’d jest as lief ’ave a pestilence come
now as to see whiskey. His stummick’s gone
punk. His eyes looks like holes burnt in a blanket,
an’ ’is head don’t fit ’im. He needs a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
kind words, an’ I’m goin’ to take ’im over a little
piece o’ the dog that bit ’im.”</p>

<p>He filled the cup to the brim and offered it to
the sufferer.</p>

<p>“Here, Cookie, cheer up! Here’s some nice
little meddy. You swallow it an’ you’ll feel fine!”</p>

<p>Pathos and misery were written on Narcissus’s
doleful face, as he mutely protested against the
cup being held where he could smell its contents.
Sipes, with refined cruelty, sprinkled some of the
liquid on the penitent’s coat, so that the odor
would remain with him, and chuckled, as he returned
the unused portion to the jug, which he
locked in the boat’s cabin.</p>

<p>One night there was a light frost. When morning
dawned there was a crispness in the air. A
spirit of foreboding was in the forest, and a sadness
in the tones of the wind that rustled the
weakly clinging leaves. The wood odors had
changed. Dashes of color brilliance were scattered
along the edges of the timber on the river
banks. The deep green of tamaracks, and flaming
scarlet of vines and dogwoods, relieved by
backgrounds of subtle and delicate minor hues,
swept along the borders of the great marsh, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
stole away into veils of purple haze beyond.
Fruition and fulfilment had passed over the hills
and through the low places, and it was time for
sleep.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="table w100">
<span class="tcell">THE REQUIEM OF THE LEAVES</span>
<span class="tcell tdr">(<i>From the Author’s Etching</i>)</span>
</p></div>

<p>The tired grasses in the marsh were bent and
gray. Among their dull masses the current of
the open stream crept in a maze of silvery lines,
that wound back in many retreating loops, and
then moved slowly on, seemingly reluctant to
enter into the oblivion of the depths beyond the
passage through the dunes.</p>

<p>Wedges of wild geese trailed across the great
clouds&mdash;valiant voyagers along the unseen paths
of the sky. In the darkness their turbulent cries
came out of the regions of the upper air, faint
echoes of the Song of Life from the vault of the
Infinite.</p>

<p>“Them winds ’as got an edge on ’em. I guess
we gotta git out o’ here, Bill,” declared Sipes, as he
warmed his numbed hands before the fire. “The
news o’ that jool’ll git ’round, an’ the fust thing
we know this country’ll be full o’ robbers. They’ll
swipe it, an’ you an’ me’ll ’ave to work the rest of
our lives, an’ mebbe eat carps, instid o’ set’n’ on
soft cushions an’ smok’n’. The clams is ’bout all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
cleaned out an’ we got a fort’n’. Wot’s the use
o’ try’n’ to grab it all? We got plenty to last us,
an’ we can’t take no cash-money to the graveyard
with us. We’ll git hold o’ that onion-skinnin’
feller, an’ mebbe ’e c’n peel some o’ them
other jools, an’ make ’em wuth a lot more.</p>

<p>“We c’n do anything we want to now. Mebbe
we’ll buy a big red church fer Holy Zeke, so ’e
c’n git in it an’ spout damnation up the chimbly
all by ’imself, an’ not come ’round us. I wonder
wot that ol’ cuss is doin’ nowdays? Anyway,
we’ll buy ’im a new hard hat, an’ a ticket that’ll
carry ’im way off.”</p>

<p>The pearls were carefully concealed on the
<i>Crawfish</i>. The sail, which had done duty as a
shelter on shore, was put back in its place, and
everything was snugly stowed on board. The
boat that Narcissus had borrowed “offen Cap’n
Peppehs” was attached, with my own, to the
stern of the larger craft, and we were ready to
push out into the current, when we saw Spotty
contemplating us with mild eyes from among
the trees.</p>

<p>“Gosh! I gotta bid that ol’ girl good-by,”
exclaimed Sipes, as he seized a pail and nimbly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
hopped ashore. When he returned the homeward
voyage began.</p>

<p>We threaded the sinuous channel for hours before
we came to the sand-hills.</p>

<p>“This big dump’s full o’ jools,” remarked
Sipes, as he indicated the marsh with a broad
sweep of his hand. “Next year we’ll come down
’ere an’ bag the whole bunch.”</p>

<p>Narcissus, who had stuck by us faithfully, was
anxious to go and spend the winter at the fish shanty.
The old men were immensely pleased both with
him and his cooking, and cheerfully consented.</p>

<p>The current took us through the hills, and we
tied up at the dilapidated pier. We were out of
tobacco, and other small necessities, and needed
some gasoline, as Sipes wanted to “tune up” the
motor, in case we found no wind on the lake.
Narcissus was provided with a list, some funds,
and the gasoline can, and he went ashore. Sipes
considered that he was perfectly reliable up to
five dollars in prohibition territory. We saw him
swinging his can gayly, as he walked up the little
path that led to the village and disappeared
around a bend. We had had a wonderful trip,
and everybody was in high spirits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>We waited nearly an hour for Narcissus, but
he did not return. We got ashore and went up
to the general store, where he was to do his shopping,
but he had not been seen. Further search
around the village was fruitless. Thinking that
he might have returned to the boat by another
route, we retraced our steps, and found the can in
some weeds near the bend where we last saw him.</p>

<p>With sudden inspiration, Sipes ran to the
boat. He dived into the cabin, and we heard an
angry yell.</p>

<p>“Holy Mike! He’s frisked the jools!”</p>

<p>We hurried on board. The tin box had
disappeared.</p>

<p>“We put ’em between them boards back o’
that little cuddy-hole. He swiped ’em an’ ’e’s
lit out! Hold on a minute!” cried the distracted
old man, as, with a glimmer of hope on his pale
face, he again ducked into the cabin.</p>

<p>“Gosh! We’r’ saved!” he exclaimed, as he
emerged with the big pearl. “Bully fer us! I
stuck this in a crack with some paper, an’ ’e
missed it.”</p>

<p>Saunders had been too much overcome by the
sudden misfortune to say much. He appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
crushed. His face lighted up when it was found
that the disaster was not complete.</p>

<p>The question now was to catch Narcissus Jackson.
He had had about two hours’ start.</p>

<p>“Gimme that gun!” commanded Sipes. “I’ll
pot that nigger, if I git ’im inside o’ fifty yards.
This gun ain’t loaded with no jools like that
Injun’s was!”</p>

<p>Adjectives are weapons of temperament. Sipes
had a plentiful supply of both. The past, present,
and future of Narcissus Jackson was completely
covered by a torrent of scarifying invective.</p>

<p>The next day we gave up the search, in which
we were excitedly assisted by the villagers and
scattered farmers. We returned to the boat and
rowed it out into the calm lake, where we waited
for a breeze. The motor had again “gone punk.”</p>

<p>“That smoke’s jest natch’ally drifted off,” remarked
Sipes philosophically, as we floated idly
on the gentle swells, “but we got enough to make
us rich; wot do we care? I guess that ‘dark
secret’ that Bill said this trip was, was set’n on
them rocks w’en we fust come in the river. Think
of all wot we done fer ’im! Me offerin’ ’im that
whole cupful w’en ’e was sick, an’ git’n’ milk fer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
’im to cook with, an’ all them things you an’
Bill did, an’ now ’e’s hornswoggled us. They
ain’t no gratitude. That smoke’s jest like all the
rest of ’em!”</p>

<p>“You have had a prosperous trip,” I replied.
“You will probably get a high price for your big
pearl, and you won’t have to worry about money
for quite a while. You had better get this trouble
off your mind. Surplus wealth is mere dross.”</p>

<p>“How much dross d’ye think that damn cookie’ll
git fer them jools?”</p>

<p>“He will get very little. You had spoiled the
lustre on most of them by constantly shaking
the box.”</p>

<p>“If I’d knowed ’e was goin’ to frisk ’em, I’d a
shook the stuff’n’ out of ’em!”</p>

<p>During a visit to the village store, Saunders
had written a letter to the “onion-skinner,” as
Sipes persisted in calling the pearl-buyer, and
mailed it to the address on the margin of the
pamphlet. He described the location of the fish
shanty, and informed him of the finding of the
big pearl. He also told of the robbery, described
Narcissus, and asked him to have him “nabbed”
if he came to sell him the stolen pearls, which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
probably would do. Saunders spent much time
writing and rewriting the letter. Sipes stood over
him and cautioned him repeatedly not to say anything
in it that “looked like we wanted to sell
the jool.”</p>

<p>“Cat’s paws” appeared on the water. The
breeze freshened rapidly, and there were white-caps
on the lake shortly after we began to make
fair headway. The wind increased, the boat
careened under the pressure of the broad sail,
and we shipped water copiously several times.
Fortunately I had left my row-boat and tent with
a fisherman at the village, who was to care for
them during the winter, so we did not have these
to bother us. I felt relieved when we saw the
shanty in the distance.</p>

<p>“Hard-a-port, Bill,” commanded Sipes in a
stentorian tone as he loosened the main-sheet.
We turned in toward shore. Like a roving galleon
proudly returning from distant seas, with her
treasure in her hold, the gallant <i>Crawfish</i> tore in
through the curling waves and flying spray, and
felt the foam of her home waters over her prow.</p>

<p>We all got soaking wet getting in through the
surf. The long rope from the windlass on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
sand, composed of many odd pieces, knotted together,
was finally attached to the iron ring on
the bow, and the now historic craft was hauled out
over the wooden rollers to its berth on the beach.</p>

<p>We had commenced taking some of the stuff
out of the boat, when we suddenly paused with
astonishment, and looked toward the shanty.
Mingled with the voices of the wind, and the roar
of the surf, we faintly, but unmistakably, heard
the thrilling strains of “Money Musk” issuing
from the weather beaten structure.</p>

<p>“Now wot d’ye think o’ that!” exclaimed
Sipes. “That damn cookie’s in there. He don’t
know it’s our place an’ ’e thinks ’e’s escaped. We
got ’im trapped. Gimme the gun!</p>

<p>I happened to know that the gun was not
loaded, and had no fears that there would be any
shooting. In solid formation we marched to the
shanty. The padlock on the door was undisturbed.
Sipes unlocked it. Narcissus sat on the
pile of nets inside and regarded us with a frightened
expression. Evidently the wind had prevented
him from hearing us when we landed.
He seemed overawed by the presence of the gun
and our angry looks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<p>“Say, Boss, lemme off!” he begged, as he
looked up at me pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Narcissus, where are those pearls?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Pea’ls? Ah don’t know nuff’n ’bout no pea’ls!
Ah ain’t seen no pea’ls! Is theah some pea’ls
miss’n’?”</p>

<p>“Of course they’re miss’n’, an’ you know it,
you black devil!” roared Sipes, as he cocked his
gun. “You shell out them jools, er yer goin’ to
be shot right ’ere this minute!”</p>

<p>Narcissus’s face turned ashen gray.</p>

<p>“Ah ain’t nevah touched no pea’ls! Ah ain’t
nevah seen you gen’lemen’s pea’ls since you had
’em at the camp. Gimme a Bible an’ Ah’ll take
ma oath!”</p>

<p>While I knew that he was quite safe in asking
Sipes for a Bible, his earnest denial seemed to
have the ring of sincerity. I took Sipes aside,
leaving Saunders with the now thoroughly terrified
negro. He leaned against the side of the
shanty and seemed in such mental agony that
I felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>I asked Sipes to show me exactly where he had
placed the tin box. With a small electric flashlight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
we explored a deep recess between the
boards back of the cuddy-hole, and found the
box, wedged about a foot below where the old
man had hidden it. Sipes seized it with a shout
of jubilation. He and Saunders acted like a
couple of small boys who had just been told that
they could stay out of school and go to a circus.</p>

<p>The mystery of Narcissus’s disappearance and
his presence in the shanty was still to be explained.
He was greatly relieved when the box was found,
but seemed too much confused by the sudden
flood of events to talk, so we let him alone. That
night, after the shanty was put in order, and a
fire built in the stove, he told his story.</p>

<p>“When Ah took that gas can, an’ went fo’
them things at the stoah, Ah jest thought Ah’d
stop at Cap’n Peppehs’s house. That’s the fi’st
li’l house Ah come to. Ah wanted to thank ’im
fo’ the boat Ah got offen ’im, an’ tell ’im Ah hoped
’e was well. Ah left the can neah the path.
Cap’n Peppehs asked me all about you gen’lemen,
an’ wanted me to come in a minute. He wanted
to know what you-all had done up the rivah, an’
if you got any pea’ls. Ah didn’t tell ’im nuff’n.
Then ’e got out ’is bottle, an’ we had some drinks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
Then ’e asked me ’bout yo’ motah, an’ how you
come by it. I told ’im you got it offen a fish man
named John. Then ’e told me John got it f’om
him, an’ ’e didn’t want me to let you know that.”</p>

<p>“And to think,” interrupted Sipes, “that we had
that cuss right in the boat, an’ didn’t know it!”</p>

<p>“Then, aftah a while, we got to feel’n’ pretty
good, an’ Ah done fergot all ’bout the gasoline.
We looked out o’ the window, an’ theah was Mr.
Sipes goin’ ’round with ’is gun. We didn’t know
whethah he thought Ah’d run off with that li’l
bunch o’ money Ah was goin’ to get the things
with, er was aftah Cap’n Peppehs’ ’count o’ that
motah, an’ Ah jest thought we’d keep still fo’
a while ’till Mr. Sipes put away ’is gun. Ah was
sca’ed o’ that gun. Aftah that Cap’n Peppehs
asked me mo’ about the pea’ls, an’ offe’d me a
li’l mo’ ref’eshment. Ah must ’a’ went to sleep
then, an’ Ah didn’t wake up ’til this mawnin’.
Ah saw yo’ boat way out on the lake set’n’ still.
I shuah felt bad, an’ Ah was goin’ to take a boat
an’ row out, but ma haid hurt so Ah couldn’t.
Ah knew ’bout wheah you lived, ’cause Ah hea’d
you talkin’ ’bout it, an’ Ah jest walked ’long the
beach ’til Ah come to the place that had yo’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
sign. The do’ was locked, but Ah got the window
open an’ come in that way. Ah was ve’y
ti’ed, an’ laid down fo’ a nap; then Ah got up an’
played that li’l tune Mr. Sipes likes so much.</p>

<p>“Say, Ah hope you’ll lemme off. Ah ain’t
done nuff’n so awful bad. Ah’m awful sorry Ah
made all that trouble, an’ had all them drinks
with Cap’n Peppehs. Ah fo’got all ’bout that
gasoline, an’ Ah won’t nevah do nuff’n like that
no mo’. Mr. Sipes, does theah happ’n to be jest
a few drops in the bottom o’ the jug, that Ah c’d
have? Honest, Ah feels weak!”</p>

<p>Narcissus met with the full measure of forgiveness.
He had faltered by the wayside, where
hosts have fallen. The mantle of charity was laid
over his sin. Sipes, while usually intolerant, was
mollified with the recovery of the pearls.</p>

<p>We all slept in the shanty that night. In the
morning we saw a horse and buggy on the beach
in the distance. Saunders inspected the driver
attentively through the “spotter.”</p>

<p>“That’s the onion-skinner comin’,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I bet we’ll be the onions,” said Sipes,
as he took the glass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>The visitor arrived and looked over the fruits
of the season’s work. He did not seem at all
dazzled by the beauty of the big pearl. He examined
it casually and laid it aside. He seemed
more interested in the others.</p>

<p>“You be careful an’ don’t show no frenzy over
that jool. You don’t own it,” cautioned Sipes,
sarcastically. “You may want to buy it later if
you ain’t got enough cash-money now. Mebbe
you know o’ some rich fellers that ’ud like to buy
intrusts in it with you.”</p>

<p>A substantial offer was made for the lot. The
amount mentioned was much larger than I had
any idea the pearls were worth.</p>

<p>“They was a feller ’long ’ere yisterd’y that
offered us twice as much as that, an’ I told ’im
’e was a cheap skate. Wot d’ye think them are&mdash;peanuts?
D’ye think we c’lected all them
val’able jools jest fer love o’ you? Wot d’ye
s’pose we are&mdash;helpless orphants?”</p>

<p>Most of the day was spent in jockeying over
the price. The buyer was an expert judge of
human nature, as well as pearls. He exhibited
a large roll of bills at a psychological moment,
and became the owner of the collection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>He drove away along the beach and turned
into the dunes.</p>

<p>“He’ll prob’ly hide some’r’s off’n the woods, an’
peel some o’ them jools, like ’e did us,” said
Sipes. “He oughta fly a black flag over that
buggy, so people ’ud know wot’s comin’. I’ve
seen piruts in furrin waters that was all bloodied
up, but ’side o’ that robber, they’d look like a
lot o’ funny kids. Bill, you oughta keep yer
mouth shut w’en I’m sell’n’ jools! You butted
in all the time an’ spoilt wot I was doin’. If
you’d a kep’ still, I’d ’a’ got jest twice them figgers.
By rights, I oughta keep wot’s ’ere fer my
half an’ let you w’istle fer the half that that
feller saved by you shoot’n’ off yer mouth at the
wrong times.”</p>

<p>That night I sat before the dying embers of
driftwood and mused over the eventful weeks.</p>

<p>I remembered the picturesque camp scenes;
the genial gatherings around the fire; the advent
of Narcissus,&mdash;his lovable qualities, frailties, and
final vindication; the sociability of Spotty; the
Ancient’s graphic reminiscences; the finding of
the big pearl, and the odd combination of childish
foibles, homely wit, kindliness, cupidity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
shrewdness, and primitive savagery in the old
shipmates.</p>

<p>The mingled glories of the autumn came back,
with memories of the fragrant woods; the broad
sweeps of changing color over the swamp-land; the
majesty of the onward marching storms; the songs
of the wind through trees and bending grasses;
the music and beauty of rippling currents; the
companionship and voices of the wild things; the
witchery of twilight mists and purple shadows,
and the enchantment of moon-silvered vistas.</p>

<p>I felt again the haunting mystery that is over
the marsh, along the river through the silent
nights, and in its fecund depths, where pearls are
wrought among hidden eddies.</p>

<p>Under the gently moving water was the dreamland
of the reflections. The dark forests and the
ghostly dunes hung low in the realm of unreality.
Beyond them the Pleiades and Orion glowed
softly in the limitless abyss that held the endless
story of the stars.</p>

<p>The Ego, mocking the Infinite with puny
dogma, in its minute orbit&mdash;a speck between
two eternities&mdash;recoils in terror from the void
beyond the world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<p>The river bears a secret in its bosom deeper
than its pearls. He who learns it has found the
melodies that brood among tremulous strings in
the human heart.</p>

<p>I meditated, and wondered if I, or the valiant
crew of the flatboat, had found the Winding
River’s Treasure?

THE PLUTOCRATS</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> invitation of the old shipmates to
remain with them for a while was gratefully
accepted. The witchery of the
changing landscapes and the color-crowned dunes
was irresistible. The society of my odd friends,
which was full of human interest, and certain
beguiling promises made by Narcissus, were factors
that prolonged the stay.</p>

<p>After a week of blustery weather, and a light
fall of snow, the haze of Indian Summer stole
softly over the hills. The mystic slumberous
days had come, when, in listless reverie, we may
believe that the spirits of a vanished race have
returned to the woods, and are dancing around
camp fires that smoulder in hidden places. Spectral
forms sit in council through the still nights,
when the moon, red and full-orbed, comes up
out of a sea of mist. Smoke from phantom wigwams
creeps through the forest. Unseen arrows
have touched the leaves that carpet aisles among
the trees where myriad banners have fallen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>Our drift-wood fire glowed on the beach in the
evening. Sipes piled on all sorts of things that
kept it much larger than necessary. With reckless
prodigality, he dragged forth boxes, damaged
rope, broken oars, and miscellaneous odds and
ends, that under former conditions would have
been carefully kept.</p>

<p>Sipes and Saunders were in high spirits. They
walked with an elastic swagger that bespoke
supreme confidence in themselves, and a lofty
disdain of the rest of the world. There was much
discussion of plans for the future.</p>

<p>“We got all kinds o’ money now, an’ we c’n
spread out,” declared Sipes. “We gotta git ol’
John an’ ’is horse down ’ere, an’ take care of ’em.
That ol’ nag’s dragged millions o’ pounds o’ fish
’round fer us, an’ ’e oughta have a rest. They’r’
both git’n’ too old to work any more, an’, outside
o’ me an’ Bill an’ Cookie, them’s the only ones
that lives round ’ere that’s fit to keep alive through
the cold weather.</p>

<p>“We gotta haul down that ol’ sign on the
shanty, ’cause we’ve gone out o’ the fish business.
We’r’ goin’ to fix this place all over. All them
fellers that has money, an’ lives in the country,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
an’ don’t work, has signs out that’s got names on
’em fer their places. I drawed out the new sign
with the pencil yisterd’y, an’ this is wot it’s goin’
to be.”</p>

<p>He unfolded a piece of soiled wrapping paper,
on which he had rudely lettered&mdash;

<span class="figcenter">
<img class="figcenter" id="i225" src="images/i225.jpg" alt="" />
<span class="figcenter">$HiPMATE$ RE$T</span></span></p>

<p>“The names won’t be on it, but shipmates’ll
mean us all right. The sign’ll still look like cash-money,
an’ you bet we’r’ goin’ to rest, so that
sign’s all right, an’ she’s goin’ up.”</p>

<p>Catfish John and Napoleon arrived the next
morning.</p>

<p>“You can’t git no more fish ’ere!” announced
Sipes, after he had made his usual derisive comments
on the old peddler’s general appearance.
“This place ’as changed hands. Some fellers
own it now that don’t ’ave to work. You’r’ a
wuthless ol’ slab-sided wreck, an’ you ain’t no
good peddlin’ fish. You oughta be ’shamed o’
yerself. Yer ol’ horse is a crowbait, an’ yer fish
waggin’s on the bum. You git down offen it an’
come ’ere. We got sump’n we want to tell you.”</p>

<p>John willingly admitted that all the charges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
were true, as he slowly and painfully descended
from the rickety vehicle.</p>

<p>“Now listen ’ere, John,” continued Sipes seriously,
“us fellers ’as got rich out o’ the jools wot
we fished out o’ the river. We’r’ jest goin to set
’round an’ look pleasant, an’ quit work’n. You’ve
been our ol’ friend fer years, an’ we got enough
to keep you an’ Napoleon in tobaccy an’ hay fer
the rest o’ yer lives. You’re a nice pair, an’ if
you’ll go in the lake an’ wash up, we’ll burn all
yer ol’ nets, an’ the other stuff up to your place,
an’ yer ol’ boat, too, an’ you c’n come down ’ere
an’ live. We don’t want none o’ them things
’ere, fer it ’ud make us tired to look at ’em. We
don’t want to see nothin’ that looks like work
’round ’ere, no more’n we c’n help, but you gotta
help haul some lumber. We’r’ goin’ to tack some
more rooms on the shanty. It ain’t a fit place
fer fellers like us to live in.”</p>

<p>John was greatly pleased over the good fortune
that had come to his friends, and happy over
the plans that had been made for his future. He
said little, but I noticed that his eyes were moist
as he limped over to the shanty to be “interduced
to Cookie.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>“Ah ce’t’nly am glad to meet you, Mr. Catfish!”
said Narcissus, cordially, as they shook
hands. “Ah’ve hea’d a great deal ’bout you
f’om these gen’lemen. Ah would like to make a
li’l cup o’ coffee fo’ you. Jest have a seat an’
Ah’ll have it ready in jest a few minutes.”</p>

<p>John looked at him gratefully and sat down.
He was much impressed by the evidences of
prosperity around him. The old pine table was
covered with a cloth that was spotless, except
where Sipes had spilled a “loose egg” on one
corner of it. There was a bewildering array of
new clean dishes and kitchen utensils about the
room, and some boxes that had not yet been unpacked.
Narcissus had been given <i>carte blanche</i>
as to the domestic arrangements. He was chef,
valet, major domo, and general manager.</p>

<p>“Cookie’s boss o’ the eats an’ the beds, an’
ev’rythin’ else ’round the house, ’cept drinks,”
declared Saunders.</p>

<p>He had made several trips to the village with
the old cronies and they had acquired a large part
of the stock of the general store. Their advent
must have been a godsend to the aged proprietor.</p>

<p>“Now, John,” said Sipes, after the old man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
had finished his coffee, “you c’n go back to yer
place jest once, an’ fetch anythin’ you want to
keep that’s small, but don’t you bring nothin’
that weighs over a pound, an’ then you come an’
sleep in the cabin o’ the <i>Crawfish</i> till we git the
new fix’n’s on the shanty. We’ll feed you up so
you’ll feel like a prize-fighter, an’ we’ll make
Napoleon into a spring colt. He c’n stay in the
work-shed ’til we make a barn fer ’im. We’r’
goin’ up there tomorrer night, an’ we’r’ goin’ to
burn up the whole mess wot you leave, an’ you
can’t go with us. We’ll chuck ev’rythin’ into
that cusséd ol’ smoke-house, an’ set fire to it.
Tomorrer night’s the night, an’ don’t you fergit
it!”</p>

<p>John stayed for a couple of hours, but did little
talking. Evidently he was deeply touched. He
drove away slowly up the beach toward the only
home he had known for many years. His quiet,
undemonstrative nature was calloused by the
unconscious philosophy of the poor. Gratitude
welled from a fountain deep in his heart, but its
outward flow was restrained by the rough barriers
that a lifetime of unremitting toil and poverty
had thrown around his honest soul.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>He returned late the following afternoon. His
wagon contained a few things that he said he
wanted to keep, no matter what happened to him.</p>

<p>“Thar ain’t no value to the stuff I got ’ere,
’cept to me. If you’ll put this in a safe place
’til things git settled, I’ll be much obliged,” said
the old man, as he extracted a small package
from an inside pocket. He carefully opened it
and showed us an old daguerreotype. A rather
handsome young man, dressed in the style of the
early fifties, sat stiffly in a high-backed chair.
Beside him, trustfully holding his hand, was a
sweet-faced girl in bridal costume. Pride and
happiness beamed from her eyes.</p>

<p>“That thar’s me an’ Mary the day we was
married. She died the year after it was took,”
said the old fisherman, slowly. There was tenderness
in the quiet look that he bestowed on the
picture, and the care with which he rewrapped it
and handed it to Saunders for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>The old daguerreotype had been treasured for
over half a century. I knew that tears had fallen
upon it in silent hours. Its story was in the old
man’s face as he turned and walked over to his
wagon to get the rest of his things.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>“Now, hooray fer the fireworks!” shouted
Sipes, when we had finished our after-dinner
pipes in the evening. By the light of the lantern,
the small row-boat was shoved into the lake.
John watched the sinister preparations with misgivings.
As we rowed away, Sipes called out
cheerily, “Now you brace up, John; you ain’t
got no kick comin’! You c’n stay an’ play with
Cookie. He’ll make you some more coffee, an’
you’ll find a big can o’ tobaccy on the shelf.”</p>

<p>The old shipmates did not intend that any
lingering affection that John might retain for his
old habitat, or any heartaches, should interfere
with his enjoyment of his new home, or with their
delight in burning his old one. They had grimly
resolved that the transition should be complete
and irrevocable.</p>

<p>We reached the old fisherman’s former abode
in due time. We found the tattered nets wound
on the reels, which were old and much broken.
We piled all of the loose stuff on the beach around
the nets, and the leaky boat was set up endwise
against them. With the lantern we explored the
disreputable little smoke-house. It was filled
with fish tubs, bait pails, and confused rubbish,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and was redolent with fishy odors of the past
that Saunders declared “a clock couldn’t tick
in.”</p>

<p>We climbed up to the shanty on the edge of the
bluff. The door of the ramshackle structure was
fastened with a piece of old hitching strap that
was looped over a nail. We entered and looked
around the squalid interior. Four bricks in the
middle of the room supported a nondescript stove.
A rough bench stood against the wall, and a few
tin plates, cups, and kettles were scattered about.
The only other room was John’s sleeping apartment.
A decrepit bedstead, that had seen better
days and nights, an old hay mattress, a couple
of much soiled blankets, a cracked mirror, some
candle stubs, and two broken chairs were the
only articles we found in it.</p>

<p>“All some people needs to make ’em happy is
a lookin’ glass,” observed Sipes, “but ol’ John
ain’t stuck on ’imself; wot does ’e want with it?
He prob’ly busted it w’en ’e peeked in it to see
if ’is ol’ hat was on straight.”</p>

<p>“I hope John’s got some insurance on this place,”
Saunders remarked, as he dragged the mattress
to the wall and piled the bedstead and chairs on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
it. We found a bottle half full of kerosene under
the bench, which we emptied over the floor.</p>

<p>“Now gimme a match!” demanded Sipes.</p>

<p>When we reached the foot of the bluff the
flames were merrily at work above us. The
smoke-house, and the stuff accumulated around
the nets, were soon on fire. We next visited
Napoleon’s humble quarters on the sand, and
another column of smoke and flame was added to
the joy of the occasion.</p>

<p>“We can’t leave fer a while yet,” said Saunders;
“no fire’s any good ’less somebody’s ’round to
poke it.”</p>

<p>We spent considerable time watching the fires,
to assure ourselves that the destruction was complete,
and that there was no possibility of the
flames on the bluff getting into the woods beyond
through the dry weeds on the sand. There was
a light off-shore breeze, so there was little danger.</p>

<p>“That ol’ joint’s clean at last,” observed Sipes, as
we rowed away in the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>From far away we looked upon the scene of
Catfish John’s dreary life, illumined by gleams
from the smouldering embers that played along
the face of the bluff.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>There were essentials that the old man’s humble
surroundings had lacked. Long sad years
were interwoven with them, but the faded face
in the old daguerreotype may have lighted the
dark rooms and helped to make the lonely place
an anchorage, for is home anywhere but in the
heart? It does not seem to consist of material
things. Absence, estrangement, and death destroy
it&mdash;not fire. Sometimes, out of the losses
and wrecks of life, it is rebuilded, but not of wood
and stone.</p>

<p>I arranged with John to transport my few
belongings to the railroad station the next day,
and regretfully left the contented old mariners
and their happy “cookie,” who was no small
part of the riches that had come from the Winding
River.</p>

<p>On the way through the hills the old man
opened his heart.</p>

<p>“Now wot d’ye think o’ them ol’ fellers? They
battered ’round the seas an’ they been up ag’in
pretty near ev’rythin’ they is. They come in
these hills an’ settled down to fish’n’. We alw’ys
got ’long well together. I done little things fer
them an’ they done little things fer me. Sipes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
is a queer ol’ cod, an’ so’s Saunders, but all of us
has quirks, an’ they ain’t nobody that pleases
ev’rybody else. Now them ol’ fellers has got rich.
I don’t know how much they got, but w’en anybody
gits a lot o’ money you c’n alw’ys tell wot
they really was all the time they didn’t have it.
They’r’ all right, an’ you bet I like ’em, an’ I
alw’ys did. They drink some, but they don’t go
to town an’ go ’round all day shoppin’ in s’loons,
like some fellers do. Mebbe they’ll git busted
some day, an I c’n do sump’n fer ’em like they
done fer me.”</p>

<p>I bade my old friend farewell on the railroad
platform and departed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In response to a letter sent to him in January,
John was at the station when I stepped off the
train one crisp morning a week after I wrote, but
it was a metamorphosed John who stood before
me. He was muffled up in a heavy overcoat and
fur cap. He wore a gray suit, new high-topped
boots, and leather fur-backed gloves. I hardly
recognized him. Much as I was delighted with
these evidences of his comfort, there was an inward
pang, for the picturesque and fishy John,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
who had been one of the joys of former years,
was gone. This was a reincarnation. The strange
toggery seemed discordant. Somehow his general
air, and the protuberance of his high coat collar
above the back of his head, suggested an Indian
chief, great in his own environment, who had
been rescued out of barbarism and debased by
an unwelcome civilization. He was like some
rare old book that had been revised and expurgated
into inanity.</p>

<p>“I got yer letter,” said the old man, after our
greetings, “an’ ’ere I am! I yelled out at ye, fer I
didn’t think you’d know me. What d’ye think o’
all this stuff them ol’ fellers ’as got hooked on me?”</p>

<p>Napoleon, sleek and apparently happy, with a
new blanket over him, was standing near the
country store, hitched to a light bobsled.</p>

<p>I congratulated the old man and inquired about
our mutual friends. After we had put the baggage
and some supplies from the store into the sled, we
adjusted ourselves comfortably under a thick robe,
and Napoleon trotted away on the road, with a
merry jingle of two sleigh-bells on his new harness.</p>

<p>There were no tracks on the road after we got
into the wooded hills, except those made by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Napoleon and the sled a couple of hours before,
and the cross trails of rabbits and birds that had
left the tiny marks on the snow, in their search
for stray bits of food that the frost and winter
winds might have spared for their keeping.</p>

<p>Nature in her nudity is prodigal of alluring
charms on her winter landscapes. The forests,
cold, still, and bare, stretched away over the undulating
contours of the dunes in their mantle
of snow. The lacery of naked branches, silvered
with frost, was etched against the moody sky.</p>

<p>He who is alone in the winter woods is in a
realm of the spirit where the only borders are the
limits of fancy. The big trees, like sentinels grim
and gray, seem to keep watch and ward over the
treasures that lie in the hush of the frozen ground,
where a mighty song awaits the wand of the
South Wind. The winding sheet that lies upon
the white hills hides the promise as well as the
sorrow. The great mystery of earth’s fecundity
that is under the chaste raiment of the snow is
the mystery of all life, and to it the questioning
soul must ever come. The message of our loved
ones, who are under the white folds, may be
among the petals of the flowers when they open.

<p>When we descended the steep road to the
beach, we saw Shipmates’ Rest in the distance.
Saunders came out to greet us on our arrival.
He was enveloped in a heavy reefer, and wore
a rather sporty-looking new cap. He conducted
us into what was once the fish shanty, but, alas,
what a change! It had been almost entirely rebuilt.
There were five rooms. A stairway led
to a trap door in the roof, above which was a
railed-in, covered platform. A stone fireplace had
replaced the old stove, and there was a large new
cook stove in the kitchen, where Narcissus reigned
supreme. I was struck with the almost immaculate
cleanliness of the place. While the architecture
was nerve-racking, and seemed to pursue
lines of the most resistance, it looked very comfortable.</p>

<p>“Sipes is out hunt’n rabbits. He’ll be back
shortly,” said Saunders. “You jest hang up yer
things an’ make yerself to home. Cookie’s out
back undressin’ some fowls, an’ ’e’ll be glad to
see you.”</p>

<p>Narcissus soon appeared with a grin on his
honest face.</p>

<p>“Ah ce’t’nly am glad to see you down heah
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
again!” he exclaimed. “Ah was just fixin’ some
chick’ns, an’ tomorrow we’ll have a fracassee with
dumplin’s. Chick’ns have to wait ovah night in
salt watah fo’ they ah cooked, but we got pa’tridges
fo’ today. Ah you fond of them?”</p>

<p>Idle questions, propounded simply to make conversation,
often inspire doubt of normal mentality.
I had brought a new mouth organ and a
ukelele for him from the city, and his delight over
the little gifts quite repaid their cost.</p>

<p>My old friend Sipes arrived during the next
hour, without any rabbits, and we had a happy
reunion over the delicately roasted partridges.
There were six of them, with little bits of bacon
on their breasts&mdash;like decorations for valor on
the field.</p>

<p>Sipes presided at the head of the table with the
air of a medieval robber baron who had returned
to his castle from a successful foray. A napkin
was tied around his neck, and he wielded his
knife and fork with impressive gusto. Prosperity
had begun to bubble. I was told the prices
of everything in sight, and informed of the cost
of the glass that he had used to make a small
skylight in the north room, so as to adapt it for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
a studio. In the fall I had jokingly alluded to
something of this kind, but had no idea that it
would be included in the plans. Compensation
was grandly refused.</p>

<p>“You’r’ in on all this, an’ we want you to stick
’round ’ere w’en you ain’t got nothin’ else to do.
You knowed us w’en we didn’t ’ave a dollar, an’
you thought jest as much of us, so you quit talkin’
’bout payin’ fer sky-view glass. There’s nothin’
doin’!”</p>

<p>During the afternoon we heard intermittent
strains of “Money-Musk” from the new mouth
organ in the kitchen, accompanied by experimental
fingering of the ukelele. Narcissus had
devised an ingenious framework, which he had
put on his head, to hold the mouth organ in place,
and enable him to use his hands for the other instrument,
but it was only partially successful.</p>

<p>One of the objects of the winter visit was to
make some sketches of Saunders and Narcissus
for this volume, which had been neglected during
the fall. They seemed pleased, and were willing
models. Saunders insisted on wetting and combing
his hair carefully, and getting into stilted attitudes.
He was finally persuaded to let his hair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
alone and wear his old cap. He was anxious that
his ancient meerschaum pipe should be in the
picture. It seeped with the nicotine of many years.</p>

<p>“The tobaccy that’s been puffed in that ol’
pipe ’ud cover a ten-acre lot,” he declared, and I
believed him. “You can’t show that in the
pitcher, but you c’n make it look kind o’ dark
like. Gener’ly I smoke ‘Bosun’s Delight’ an’
it’s pretty good. It’s strong stuff an’ none of it
ever gits swiped.”</p>

<p>When the drawing was finished he criticized it
severely, which was quite natural, for no human
being is entirely without vanity. Portrait artists,
like courtiers, must flatter to succeed.</p>

<p>Narcissus also wanted a pipe in his picture. He
thought it would look better than a mouth organ,
and, as it was much easier to draw, I humored
him. He posed with unctuous ceremony, and assumed
some most serious and baffling expressions.</p>

<p>Sipes watched the proceedings with interest,
and enlivened them with running comment.</p>

<p>“I been through all that lots o’ times. You
fellers ain’t got nothin’ on me, an’ if you ever git
in a book you’ll look like a couple o’ horse thieves.
I know wot e’ done to me.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>The disapproval of these particular sketches was
probably deserved. It is a fact, however, that,
while readily admitting limitations in other fields
of knowledge, there are few people who hesitate
to criticize any kind of art work authoritatively.
Their immunity from error seems to them remarkable,
and to be the result of a natural instinct
that they have possessed from childhood. “I
know what I like” is a common and much abused
expression. They who use it usually do not know
what they like or what they ought to like. The
phrase covers infinite ignorance, with a complacent
disposition of the subject. The assumption
of critical infallibility is complete before a portrait
of the critic.</p>

<p>Many otherwise intelligent critics respect only
age and established art dogma. The dead masters
haunt pedantic essayists and opulent purchasers,
who accept embalmed opinions that they
would be incapable of forming for themselves.
Extended consideration of this subject is out of
place amid the landscapes of Duneland, where
the shades of the justly revered old painters may
have deserted their madonnas and be wielding
spiritual brushes, charged with elusive tints that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
flow unerringly upon canvases as tenuous as the
evening mists. On them filmy portraits of the
old dwellers along the shore may take form and
vanish with the morning light, for in these rugged
faces are the same attributes that made humanity
picturesque centuries ago. If one of these portraits
could suddenly materialize, it would bring
a staggering price, if there was no suspicion that
a modern had painted it. Some stray rhymester
has aptly said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>If Leonardo done it,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3"><i>It is a masterpiece.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>If Mr. Lucas made it,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i3"><i>’Tis but a mass o’ grease.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“We gotta git some pitchers fer them walls,”
declared Sipes, “an’ you buy ’em fer us. Git
some colored ones that’s got boats in ’em, an’
some fight’n scenes. I’d like to git a nice smooth
han’-painted pitcher o’ John L. Sullivan, an’ I
don’t care wot it costs!”</p>

<p>The old man wanted these things to enjoy.
His purse pride had not yet suggested the idea
of posing as a connoisseur and condescending
patron of the enshrined dead, without love or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
understanding of what they did, but the germs
were there that might enthrall him in the future,
for affluence sometimes begets strange vanities.</p>

<p>Great masses of ice had been tumbled and
heaped along the shore by the winter waves, and
we saw little of the lake, except when we climbed
the bluffs. The winds howled over the desolate
beach at night in angry portent, and one morning
a driving storm came out of the north. Occasionally,
from somewhere out above the waves
that thundered against the ice, we could hear
plaintive cries of gulls that groped through the
blinding snow. The drifts piled high against the
bluffs on the wild coast. The flying flakes were
swept along in thick clouds by the fury of the
gale. The house was almost buried. The wind
subsided after about twenty-four hours, but the
snow continued and fell ceaselessly for three
days.</p>

<p>When the skies cleared we opened the trap door
to the “crow’s nest,” the covered platform over
the roof, and looked out over the white waste.
A few straggling crows accented the immaculate
expanse, the blue billows were pounding the ice
packs, and a part of the mast of the <i>Crawfish</i> protruded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
in the foreground, but everything else was
white and still.</p>

<p>We were snowbound for ten days, but contentment
reigned at Shipmates’ Rest. We dug deep
paths that enabled us to reach our water supply,
and to communicate with Napoleon in his cosy
little barn in the ravine.</p>

<p>The plentiful supply of canned goods, that
Narcissus had wisely laid in, was drawn upon for
sustenance.</p>

<p>“Them air-tights is life savers!” exclaimed Sipes,
as he mixed up some lobster, lima beans, ripe
olives, and prunes on his plate. “Wot’s the use
o’ monkeyin’ with them fresh things w’en you
c’n git grub like this that’s all cooked an’ ready?
All ye need is a can opener to live up as high
as ye want to go. Gimme some o’ that pineapple
fer this lobster, an’ pass John them dill pickles!”</p>

<p>“You better let Cookie chop up that mess fer
you an’ squirt some lollydop on it, an’ eat it with
a spoon,” advised Saunders; “yer git’n’ it all over
us!”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad they can’t can pie,” said Sipes,
“but we got pudd’n’s. Hi, there, Cookie, fetch
some o’ them little brown cans an’ tap ’em!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>Narcissus appeared with a delicious cranberry
pie, “with slats on it,” and the pudding was
forgotten.</p>

<p>“This is the life!” continued the old man, as
he broke some crackers into his coffee, “wot do
we care fer expense?”</p>

<p>Our evenings were spent in various interesting
ways. John and Narcissus had grown very
fond of each other, and they spent much time
playing checkers. Numberless sound waves went
out into the dark, over the cold snow, that
came from music, laughter, and rattling poker
chips.</p>

<p>There are many hardships in this life, both real
and imaginary, but being snowbound at Shipmates’
Rest is not one of them.</p>

<p>A typical January thaw set in, and the warm
sunshine released us from our feathery bondage.
The <i>Crawfish</i> was floated out on to the still lake,
and we voyaged to the little town at the mouth of
the river, from where I took the train for the
grimy, noise-cursed city&mdash;cursed, indeed, for the
unnecessary and preventable dirt and noise in
most of our cities would hardly be tolerated in
Hades.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>It was August when I again visited Shipmates’
Rest. There was a lazy calm on the lake, and a
delicate and peculiar odor from the evaporating
water. Scattered flocks of terns, nimble-winged
and graceful, skimmed over the surface, and
dipped, with gentle splashes, for minnows that
basked in the sun. The still air over the sandy
bluffs shimmered in the heat.</p>

<p>I found my friends in the lake, where they had
gone to get cool, and soon joined them.</p>

<p>There were more transformations on the beach.
A mouse-colored donkey stood in the shade of the
house, regarding us with wise and sleepy eyes.
A black puppy gambolled at the water’s edge,
clamoring for attention. A cow, which I recognized
as “Spotty,” stood in the creek that flowed
out of the ravine, peacefully chewing her cud and
switching flies with her abbreviated tail. A couple
of white pigs were squealing and grunting in a pen
near the little barn, and about a dozen fluffy
brown hens, attended by a dignified rooster, were
wandering over the sand after stray insects. A
tall flag-pole extended above the “crow’s nest”
on top of the house.</p>

<p>All these things were explained at length, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
we stood out on the smooth sandy bottom, with
the cool water around our necks.</p>

<p>“That anamile wot’s huggin’ the house,” said
Sipes, “is to hitch to the windlass w’en we have to
haul the boat out. Cookie calls ’im Archibald, but
’is real name’s Mike. He goes ’round an’ ’round
with the pole, like we used to do, an’ winds up
the rope. W’en we want to run the boat in the
lake, we got a block an’ tackle wot’s lashed to
that spile out’n the water. We take the rope out
from the boat to it, an’ run it back to the windlass,
an’ Mike winds ’er out fer us. That kind o’ work
ain’t fit fer nobody but a jackass, an’ ’e wouldn’t
do it if ’e had money. Mike strays ’round the
country a good deal at night fer young cabbage
an’ lettuce an’ things, but he’s gener’ly ’ere on
deck in the mornin’. Cookie bought ’im an’ the
pup in the village this summer. We gotta have a
pup, but he’s a cusséd nuisance. W’en ’e’s in ’e
yelps to git out, an’ the minute ’e’s out ’e
howls an’ scratches to git in. It takes ’bout all
o’ one feller’s time to ’tend ’im, but ’e’s lots o’
company. He’ll bark if anybody snoops ’round
at night. They’s val’ables ’ere an’ we gotta look
out. We call ’im Coonie, an’ ’e’s some dog.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Cookie’s teachin’ ’im a lot o’ tricks, an’ w’en ’e
grows up ’e’ll be good to chase patritches out o’
the brush.</p>

<p>“We bought Spotty off o’ the Ancient up the
river, an’ Cookie towed ’er in ’long the road
through the hills with a rope. Somehow I alw’ys
liked that ol’ girl, an’ we gotta have milk.</p>

<p>“Them squealers is to eat wot’s left out o’ the
kitchen, an’ next winter they’ll quit squealin’.
Them hens is from the village, too, an’ their business
is to make aigs. Next year we’ll have slews
o’ young chicks, an’ some w’ite ducks. Cookie’s
got a rubber thing wot ’e fastens on that rooster’s
bill ev’ry night w’en ’e puts ’im to bed, so ’e can’t
crow an’ roust us out in the mornin’.</p>

<p>“We got a compass an’ a binnacle an’ a new
spy-glass up in the crow’s nest. Me an’ Bill an’
John set an’ smoke up there in the shade an’ see
fellers work’n way off, an’ watch Mike windin’ up
the boat.”</p>

<p>“Tell ’im ’bout the motor, long as yer goin’ to
keep this up all day,” interrupted Saunders.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. We got a new one wot’s built in
aft o’ the cab’n. It’s got two cylinders, an’ it
works fine. We buried the old one up ’side o’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
Cal’s dog. It ’ad to be that er us. Bill, you
keep still w’en I’m talk’n!</p>

<p>“The mast an’ them halyards over the house
is to fly signals. W’en we’r’ up er down the
beach, er out buzz’n on the lake, Cookie runs up
the mess flag w’en it’s dinner time. He uses red
with w’ite edges fer chops an’ steaks, an’ the w’ite
one with a round yellow splotch in the middle
means aigs wot’s been poached. He flys that,
an’ a square o’ calico under it, w’en we’r’ goin’ to
have corn beef hash an’ aigs on top of it. He runs
up a big bunch o’ cotton cords w’en ’e’s made
oggrytong speggetties, an’ w’en the flag’s plain
brown, it means beans. There’s no knowin’ wot
that cookie’s goin’ to do next.”</p>

<p>A cool breeze came up in the evening and we
built our usual fire on the beach, more for its
subtle cheer than its heat, and talked over reminiscences
of the big snow-storm, and things that
had happened since.</p>

<p>The old sailors were in a state of opulent bliss.
All of their desires were satisfied, except, as Sipes
expressed it, “git’n even with two er three fellers
I know of,” and happiness reigned in their simple
hearts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<p>Out of the tempests of many seas, their battered
ship had come, and was anchored in a
haven of tranquillity. The languor that comes
with satiety and completion was stealing gently
over them. Life presented no riddles, and they
were without illusions. So far as their capacity
for enjoyment extended, the fair earth and the
fulness thereof was theirs. The great blue lake,
the floating clouds, the jewelled fire of the sunsets,
and the star-decked firmament belonged to
them, as much as to anybody else. Title deeds
to the sands, vine-clad hills, woods, and to the
open fields, where suppliant petals drink the rain,
could not add to their sense of possession.</p>

<p>Every comfort was around them that their
limitations could require. They were spared the
inanities and shallow snobbery of “society,” and
the many other ills that come with existence in
a sphere of vanity and hypocrisy. The gates of
higher knowledge were not opened to them. Art,
science, and literature lay in garnered hoards far
beyond their ken, but after their lives are closed,
who may judge of the futility, or award the
laurel?</p>

<p>Into this happy Arcady&mdash;this land of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
heart’s desire and hope’s fruition&mdash;softly prowled
the onion-skinner. Like an evil wind upon a
flowery lea, he crept out of the north over the
wide waters. He landed at the beach with a
boat on the still morning of a day that had promised
to be bright and fair. Eveless though this
garden was, Satan had entered.</p>

<p>Horatius T. Bascom was a man of perhaps
forty-five. His closely cropped moustache was
slightly gray. Under it was a mouth like a slit
in a letter-box. It seemed to have a certain steel-trap
quality that savored of acquirement but not
disbursement. His eyes had a shrewd, greedy expression,
and, when he frowned, small wrinkles
formed between them that somehow suggested
the lines of the dollar sign&mdash;that sordid mark
that disfigures great characters and destroys
small ones.</p>

<p>He was the type of man who signs his business
letters with a rubber stamp facsimile signature,
to facilitate legal evasion in the future. Such
letters, insulting to the recipient, are also often
stamped with a small inscription to the effect that
they were “dictated, but not read” by the cautious
sender. Altogether his personality was such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
as to prompt one to protect his watch pocket
with one hand and his scarf pin with the other
while talking with him.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” he called out glibly, as he
walked up to our group. “You seem quite cosy
around here. Have some cigars.” He produced
a handful and passed them around. We all happened
to be smoking, and Sipes was the only one
who accepted the proffered weed. He put it in
his pocket, with the remark that he would “smoke
it some other time”&mdash;a phrase that the giver
always inwardly resents, but the wily old man
may have intended it to offend.</p>

<p>We were not particularly enthusiastic over his
descent into our little circle.</p>

<p>“You look pretty cosy yerself,” said Sipes;
“how much did you git fer that big jool you
gouged us out of?”</p>

<p>“I sold it at a loss. It had a small imperfection
that I didn’t notice when I bought it. You certainly
got the best of that bargain.”</p>

<p>“They wasn’t no imperfection in yer bunch
o’ bunk w’en you was buyin’ it.”</p>

<p>We kept rather quiet and let our caller lead
the conversation, hoping that the object of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
visit would finally unravel from the tangle of his
small talk. Coonie sniffed around him a few
times, and, with unerring instinct, retreated under
the house.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of hostility that enveloped his
coming gradually dissipated during the forenoon,
and he was invited to join us when Narcissus
announced lunch.</p>

<p>“Now what you fellows ought to do,” he declared,
“is to go up the river again and drag it
more thoroughly. I think you’d find some more
pearls there that would put you well on your feet
financially. You could buy some land on the
bluff and along the shore and have a larger place.
This property will all be much more valuable
some day. You could have an automobile, and
keep more servants. If you had a bigger and
better boat you could put a small crew on it
and go anywhere in the world you wanted to.”</p>

<p>He outlined methods of using money that dazzled
imagination. Like Moses of old, Sipes and
Saunders were shown a land of allurement, from
what seemed to them a towering height. It could
be theirs, if they had the price, and the price was
in the lily-margined channel of the Winding River.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>Like most of the rest of humanity, the onion-skinner
craved “unearned increment,” and he
hoped to inveigle his hearers into procuring it
for him. The echo of the coin’s ring&mdash;a sound
that encircles the world&mdash;was in the voice of
the tempter, and the old mariners listened as to
a siren’s song.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you, if you’d like to have me,” he
declared, “and I’ll pay you a good price for your
pearls, as I did before.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye wot we’ll do,” said Sipes. “We
ain’t busy now, an’ we’ll take the <i>Crawfish</i> up to
our ol’ camp. We’ll take Cookie ’long an’ keep
things up. You c’n go out with the flatboat an’
fish fer jools. We’ll stick ’round an’ watch you
work, if we don’t git too tired, and we’ll give
you a fifth o’ wot you git. We’ll sell our jools
to somebody else, an’ w’en you sell your share
you c’n fix up with us fer our time. If you don’t
find nothin’ you won’t have to pay us much anyway,
so it’ll be a good thing fer you.”</p>

<p>While the proposition might have excited the
onion-skinner’s admiration, from a professional
point of view, he failed to see its advantages to
him. He suggested that it might be well to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
matters over for a few days, and that he “might
drop around again the latter part of the week.”</p>

<p>We helped him push his boat into the lake, and
he rowed away, leaving a writhing serpent of discontent
at Shipmates’ Rest.</p>

<p>“They’s a good deal in wot that feller says,”
declared Sipes. “I don’t think nothin’ o’ him, but
jest think wot we c’d do if we had two bar’ls o’
cash-money instid o’ one! We c’d branch out an’
buy this whole cusséd shore. We’d stick up signs
and nobody’d dast come on it!”</p>

<p>Saunders was virulent and profane in his comment
on “fellers that ain’t satisfied with wot they
got, w’en they got all they need, er ever oughta
have,” but finally admitted that “they’s a lot
more things we might do if we c’d find some more
o’ them big pearls.”</p>

<p>That evening the old cronies departed into the
moonlight for consultation. John and I sought
our couches early. Narcissus took his new mouth
organ and ukelele, and strolled off up the beach
with Coonie. They had evidently returned sometime
before midnight, for I heard loud imprecations
being bestowed on the pup by Saunders,
who had found him chewing up a deck of cards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
on the floor, when he and Sipes had come in later.
Doubtless Coonie had been ennuied and distrait,
and had longed for occupation. With all his sins,
he was a lovable little dog, and his good nature
and affection made him irresistible. He was fully
forgiven in the morning.</p>

<p>“Bill an’ me’s talked this thing all over,” announced
Sipes at the breakfast table. “This damn
onion-skinner’s got sump’n else in ’is head ’sides
jools. He wouldn’t want to go up there an’ stick
’round jest to watch us clam-fish’n’. We’ll find
out wot’s bit’n’ ’im. We’r’ goin’ to tell ’im to come
on with us, an’ we want you to go too. We’ll go
up there an’ start the camp an’ do some jool-fish’n’,
an’ have a good time, an’ mebbe we’ll git
some. That cuss bilked us on that deal last year,
an’ you bet we’r’ goin’ to git square somehow.
We’r’ goin’ to give ’im the third degree, an’ you
jest watch us fondle ’im. All such fellers as him
oughta be exported.”</p>

<p>Bascom was received with faultless urbanity
when he came again. It was agreed that he
should be simply a guest, and that operations
should be resumed on the old basis. Sipes assured
him that he would be made comfortable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>“You’ll have a fine time up there in them
woods. You c’n fish an’ loaf ’round an’ pick
posy flowers, an’ us fellers’ll find out wot’s left
in the river. Cookie’s goin’ to fix up a lot o’
stuff, an’ we’ll have a fine trip. You go an’
fetch wot you want to take ’long, an’ come early
tomorrer.”</p>

<p>The necessary preparations were made. Mike
wound the <i>Crawfish</i> into the lake. Bascom had
brought some seedy old clothes, a soft gray hat,
and some high boots. His baggage was light and
he appeared quite well prepared for an outing.
He had some interesting maps with him, which
he said would enable us to keep posted as to
exactly where we were. He brought a pocket
compass, some light fishing tackle, a leather gun
case, and I noticed, when his coat was off, that
the handle of a small revolver protruded from
his left hip pocket.</p>

<p>John was to remain in charge of the place.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you take in no bad money, an’
don’t you pay out none o’ no kind w’ile we’r’
gone,” cautioned Sipes, as we climbed into the
boat. “You take care o’ yerself, an’ don’t fall
in the water.” He bestowed a solemn wink on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
the old man as the motor began to hum, and we
departed, waving farewells to our faithful custodian.</p>

<p>The voyage to the mouth of the river was uneventful.
We tied up at the old pier, and Sipes
and Narcissus left us for an hour to do some
errands in the village. A former experience of
Narcissus in that town was disastrous, and the
old man thought “somebody’d better be ’long to
help Cookie carry things, fer ’e got overloaded
’ere once’t.”</p>

<p>Saunders and I found my small boat and tent
where they had been stored during the winter,
and got them out to take with us.</p>

<p>“That feller that Sipes is talk’n’ to up there on
the hill’s the game warden,” remarked Saunders.
“Wot d’ye s’pose ’e wants with ’im?”</p>

<p>We reëmbarked, made our way up through the
marsh, and saw our old camping ground in the
distance.</p>

<p>Out in the middle of the river we beheld Captain
Peppers on the flatboat, which we had left on
the bank the year before. He had been dragging
the stream, but had stopped work when he heard
our motor in the marsh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>“Look at that ol’ pussyfoot up there fish’n fer
jools!” exclaimed Sipes. “He looks like a bug
float’n on a chip. You c’n see ’is ol’ beak from
’ere! Listen at me josh ’im w’en we git up to
’im. He gives me pains. I’d like to know wot ’e
was ever cap’n of. It’s prob’ly one o’ them demijohn
titles. They’s slews of ’em. Fellers that
drinks a lot gits to be called Colonel an’ Major
an’ Cap’n, that ain’t never c’mmanded nothin’ er
fit nothin’ but demijohns all their lives, an’ I bet
’e’s one of ’em. The redder their noses gits the
higher up their titles goes, an’ some of ’em gits
to be gen’rals ’fore they’r laid away, an’ they’s
some s’loon jedges over to the county seat that
ain’t never been in no court ’cept to be fined fer
bein’ drunk. Don’t you start nothin’ ’bout that
ol’ motor, Bill, ’cause it won’t do now.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Cap’n!” shouted the old man, as we
came up. “Fine day, ain’t it? Cetchin’ any
mudturkles?”</p>

<p>The Captain, ill at ease, began poling the flatboat
toward the bank.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you expected to use this outfit
again, an’ I thought I’d see if they was any loose
pearls layin’ ’round ’ere. Of course now you’re
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
here you c’n go ahead. I don’t want to interfere
with you in no way.”</p>

<p>“You won’t,” replied Sipes. “We didn’t know
you was clam-fish’n w’en we fust seen you. We
thought you’d mosied up ’ere so’s to be near that
spring, an’ was jest out cruisin’ on the river fer
fun.”</p>

<p>The Captain’s nose was a little redder than
when we last saw him, but otherwise he appeared
unchanged. He was invited to land and have
lunch with us. Saunders introduced him to the
onion-skinner, liquid cheer was produced, and an
<i>entente cordiale</i> soon prevailed.</p>

<p>The big sail was again rigged as a shelter tent
in its old place, and my tent was put where it
was before. The Captain kindly helped to get
our camp in order. He showed us a few pearls
of moderate value, that he had found during the
two weeks he had been at work on the river, and
they were purchased by Bascom, at what seemed
to be a fair price. Late in the afternoon he partook
of more liquid cheer, and rowed away down the
river in his little boat.</p>

<p>That night we assembled around the fire, but
the circle was not as of old. Something was missing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
and something had been added. The atmosphere
was unsympathetic. There is a certain
psychology that pervades gatherings, both great
and small, that is subtly sensitive to influences
that are often indefinable. In this instance the
“repellent aura” was obviously the onion-skinner.
He exerted himself to be agreeable, but his <i>bonhomie</i>
was about as infectious as that of a crocodile
trying to be playful. His personality did not
harmonize with the little amenities of life, and
he was a misfit anywhere but in a financial
transaction.</p>

<p>Sipes’s habitual effervescence seemed to have
a false note. Saunders and I kept rather quiet,
and the melodies that dwelt in the volatile soul
of Narcissus were hushed.</p>

<p>The arboreal katydids were abroad in the
woods. These insects are exquisitely beautiful in
their green gowns. Like many human creatures,
they would be fascinating if they kept still, but
they stridulate boisterously and persistently.
Their scientific name&mdash;<i>Cyrtophyllus perspicillatus</i>&mdash;is
only one of the things against them.
The insects seldom move after they have established
themselves in a tree for the night, and they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
often stay in one spot from early August, when
they usually mature, until the fall frosts silence
their penetrating clamor. The green foliage provides
a camouflage that renders them practically
undiscoverable, except by accident. We hunted
for one particular offender with an electric flashlight
and murderous intent nearly half of one
night, without finding him. We hurled many
sticks and clods of earth into the tree, but failed
even to disturb his meter.</p>

<p>It is the male katydid that proclaims the
troubles of his kind to the forest world. He
begins soon after dark, and continues his
work until morning. Curiously, the female is
silent.</p>

<p>The loud dissonant sounds are produced by
friction of the wings, which have hard, drumlike
membranes and edges like curved files. He
shuffles them with a continuity that is nerve-racking.
Often I would suddenly start from
sound sleep, with an indistinct apprehension of
some impending peril.</p>

<p>One morning, after a haunted and vexatious
night in the little tent, I found that the following
impressions had crept over white paper during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
the hours of darkness, and lay beside the burned-out
candle. They are the lines of one who suffered
and should be read with reverence.</p>

<h3>A DIABOLIC CADENCE</h3>

<p><i>Into the choirs of the trees there has come a rasping,
strident, and unholy sound. A fiend in green
is mocking the transient year with mad threnody
from his eyrie among the boughs.</i></p>

<p><i>In that suspended half consciousness that hovers
along the margin of a dream, there seems to echo,
out of some vast and awful chasm, a rumbling roar
of rocks&mdash;from some abysmal smithy of the gods
within the hidden caverns of the earth where huge
boulders are being fashioned by giant hands, to be
hurled up into space, to descend with frightful crash,
and extinguish the life upon the globe.</i></p>

<p><i>In the agonized recoil of frenzied fancy from the
borders of the dream, the demonic ceaseless sawing,
of the arboreal fiend in green, arrests the fleeting
phantoms of the brain, and, like a doleful tuneless
tolling of a fractured funeral bell&mdash;like a barbaric
song of sorrow over fallen warriors&mdash;the ripping,
rasping, resonant notes mingle with the night wind,
and drown the harmonious hum of drowsy insects,
that kindly nature has sent into the world to lull
somnolent fancy into paths of dreams.</i></p>

<p><i>After the gentle prelude of the crickets&mdash;and the
lullabies of forest folk&mdash;like a mad discordant
piper, he starts a strain of dismal dole, and files
away the seconds from the onward hours. Mercilessly
across the tender human nerves, that seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
to span the taut bridge of a swaying violin, he
sweeps a berosined and excruciating bow.</i></p>

<p><i>Prolonged wailing for a “lost or stolen” love
may have disintegrated his vocal chords. His agonized
and shattered heart may have sunk into hopeless
depths, and all his articulate forces may have
been transmitted to his foliated wings, when his
belovéd was lured away by some unknown marauder&mdash;mayhap
of darker green or lovely pink.</i></p>

<p><i>The errant pair may be hidden in a distant glade&mdash;or
dingly dell&mdash;gazing upward through the
leaves, wondering “what star should be their home
when love becomes immortal,” and listening to him,
as he scrapes the melodies out of the night with that
infernal, insistent, and slang-infected song:</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>She’s beat it&mdash;she’s beat it&mdash;she’s beat it&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>Come back&mdash;come back&mdash;come back&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>You skate&mdash;you skate&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>You’ve swiped&mdash;you’ve swiped</i><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><i>My mate&mdash;my mate&mdash;my mate!</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Intermittently he seems to muffle the ragged
rhyme, and merge into virulent</i> vers libre&mdash;<i>imagistic
muse and amputated prose&mdash;containing sound
projectiles, of low trajectory, that winnow the aisles
of the forest for an erring spouse who has fled beyond
the range of common rhyme</i>.</p>

<p><i>Perhaps it’s all wrong&mdash;about this insect having
loved&mdash;for love is a holy thing, and it may be that
it abides not among the things that have wings and
stings. It would seem that he who could trill this
nerve-destroying song could know no love, or that
it was ever in the world.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p><i>It may be that this emerald villain has been outlawed
by his kind, and he’s filing, up there in the
dark, on some terrible iron thing, that he’s sharpening
to annihilate the tribe that banned him. He may
be sawing of a branch, and, if so, I hope he’s straddling
the part that’ll fall off when he’s through.
Maybe he’s got some ex-friend up there, pinioned to
the bark, and he’s boring him to death, by telling him
the same thing&mdash;the same thing&mdash;the same thing&mdash;o’er
and o’er and o’er.</i></p>

<p><i>I wish that some gliding fluffy owl, or other
rover of the darkened woods, would only pause a
moment, and divest the bough of this green-mantled
wretch, and then that some mighty ravenous bird
would collect the people we know, who come and
scrape on something that’s inside of them&mdash;lay a
sound barrage before us&mdash;fret the air with piffle,
and with sorrows all their own&mdash;and chant a woeful
ceaseless cadence, like the green arboreal fiend,
whose sonorous and satanic notes assail us from
the bough. Miscreated, malignant, and hellish
though they and the fiend may be, they all revel in
that rare joy that comes only to him who has found
his life work.</i></p>

<p><i>For our sins must we be scourged, else, why are
these people?</i></p>

<p><i>And,</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Pourquoi&mdash;pourquoi&mdash;pourquoi&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Is this</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Katydid&mdash;Katydid&mdash;Katydid?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After listening patiently to the reading of the
production, my unfeeling prosaic friend Sipes remarked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
“Gosh, we gotta git that insect ’fore it
gits dark ag’in!”</p>

<p>The Ancient called the third day after our
arrival, and spent the afternoon with us. Bascom
seemed much interested in helping to entertain
him, and got out his maps. On one of them
was indicated the names of the owners of the
different tracts of land, and we were surprised
to learn that the old man was the possessor of
the woods we were in, practically all of the land
around the marsh, and a long strip of frontage
on the lake. Captain Peppers was also a large
owner of property along the lake.</p>

<p>The veiled motive of Bascom’s trip with us was
now apparent. He wanted options for a year
on a large part of these holdings, and was willing
to pay what he considered a good price. It
seemed that on the day we came, he had had
some talk with the Captain on the subject, and
they were to take the matter up again.</p>

<p>He wanted options only on the tracts with
marsh and lake frontage, and argued that if they
were improved the rest of the land would be made
much more valuable. He had skilfully arranged
his stage setting for the object of his trip, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
claimed that the idea had just occurred to him
while he was taking this little outing. He said
that he accidentally happened to have the maps,
and had brought them along to familiarize himself
with the country he was in.</p>

<p>He made the Ancient a substantial offer for
an option on most of his holdings, at a price that
the old man did not seem inclined to consider,
but he was open to negotiation.</p>

<p>“I been livin’ ’ere most all my life, an’ I’ve
ranged ’round this ol’ marsh an’ them sand-hills
so much that I wouldn’t know how to act if they
wasn’t mine, but if you’ll git yer figgers up whar
I c’n see ’em, mebbe we’ll talk about it some
more.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Bascom to Saunders, after the
old settler had left, “this land idea is a sort of a
side issue with me. I think that perhaps a little
money might be made here, but I would have to
take some big chances. You and Sipes talk with
those fellows a little, and see if you can’t bring
them around to business, and I’ll pay you something
for it if they sign up. You might have
some influence with them. Tell them that I
mentioned to you that it was just a gamble with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
me, and probably there isn’t a chance in a hundred
that I will exercise the options at all, and
they will be ahead whatever they get out of me
now.”</p>

<p>The old shipmates agreed to do what they could
and the subject was dropped for the time being.</p>

<p>The accidental exposure of the contents of a
long fat wallet that Bascom carried inside his
vest revealed the fact that he had a large amount
of money with him, much larger than could possibly
be required for ordinary use. Evidently
he was prepared to close the business with the
owners of the land the moment their minds met.</p>

<p>“Holy Mike! Did ye see that wad?” whispered
Sipes, who was awed by the magic of the
gold certificates. “I’d like to know some way
to git that wad,” he remarked later. “I’d play
some seven-up with ’im fer some of it, but they’s
sump’n ’bout ’im that makes me think it wouldn’t
do.”</p>

<p>I realized that the despoiler was at the gates of
the Dune Country. The foot of the Philistine
was on holy ground. This man with a withered
soul was an invader of sanctuary. He would
tear the dream temples down that the centuries
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
had builded. With steam shovels and freight
cars he would level the undulating hills, and haul
away their shining sands to a world of greed,
where man does not discriminate. The wild life
would flee from steam whistles that shrieked
through the forests, and from smoke that defiled
the quiet places. Belching chimneys and unsightly
signs would befoul and deface the fair
domain. With the beauty of the dunes he would
feed a Moloch in the sordid town.</p>

<p>The peaceful marsh, and the river with its
channel of silver light, would be invaded with
dredges. Abbatoirs, tanneries, factories, and blast
furnaces might come. The Winding River, with
its halo of memories, would flow away with receding
years, and a foul stream would carry the
stain of desecration and filth out to pollute the
crystal depths of the lake.</p>

<p>“Improvements” were contemplated in Duneland,
and the spectre of hopeless ugliness hovered
along its borders. The altar of Mammon awaited
a sacrifice, for “money might be made here” if
certain manufacturing interests, to which Bascom
vaguely alluded, “could be induced to utilize
these now practically worthless wastes of sand.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span></p>

<p>In years to come the wild geese may look down
from their paths through the soiled skies, to the
earth carpet below them, and wonder at the
creatures that have changed it from a fabric of
beauty to a source of evil odors and terrifying
sounds.</p>

<p>The clam-fishing was unsatisfactory. The mollusks
seemed to be about exhausted. Sipes and
Saunders worked faithfully for several days, but
only found a dozen or so, and none of them contained
pearls.</p>

<p>“We gotta wait fer a new crop,” declared Saunders,
who was disgusted with the whole trip and
wanted to go home.</p>

<p>Bascom persuaded the old sailors to remain a
few days, to give the Ancient a chance to come
back, and to impress the Captain at the village
with the idea that he was in no hurry to see him.
They had no love for that red-nosed worthy and
acquiesced.</p>

<p>The flatboat was restored to its berth on the
bank, and in the early morning Sipes and Saunders
made a trip to the village in the <i>Crawfish</i>.
On their return at lunch time they reported that
they had seen nothing of the Captain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

</p></div>

<p>I spent the afternoon up the river and heard
a great many shots echoing through the woods.
When I returned to camp I found that Bascom
had been out shooting robins. There were thirty-seven
of the innocent little redbreasts in his
bloody bag, and the game warden was with him
when he returned from his shameful expedition.</p>

<p>It seemed that Sipes, when he arrived from
the village, had pictured to Bascom the glories
of a certain robin pie, “with little dumplins,”
that he said Narcissus had once compounded,
and the fascinated onion-skinner, although knowing
that it was illegal to kill songsters, had taken
the risk of going out with his gun to obtain
material for another one. He was mad all the
way through, but was a much subdued man.</p>

<p>“Them robins is song birds, an’ it’s ag’in the
law to kill ’em at any time,” said the warden.
“They’re wuth ten dollars apiece an’ costs to
the state, an’ you’ve got to go to the county seat
with me. Mebbe you’ll be jugged too, fer they’re
pretty severe with fellers that shoot little birds.”</p>

<p>Bascom offered to fix up the matter privately,
on a liberal financial basis, but the minion of the
law was inexorable. The culprit must have regarded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
that part of the country as most peculiar
and inhospitable.</p>

<p>Erskine Douglas Potts, the game warden, was a
lengthy loose-jointed individual. One eye drooped
in a peculiar way, and seemed to rove independently
of the other. Sipes declared that “Doug’
c’n look up in a tree with one eye, an’ down a
hole with the other lamp at the same time.” Odd
humor radiated from him and he had a deep sense
of his dignity as an upholder of the “revised stat-toots.”
Two printed copies of the state game
laws protruded from the top of his trousers, where
they were secured by a safety pin. “Casey,” his
small yellow dog, was his inseparable companion.
They were a devoted pair of chums and Potts
refused to allow a “pitcher” to be made of him
unless the dog was included.</p>

<p>Casey was an animal of rare acumen. He had
once taken the prize at a village dog-show, where
intelligence and not breeding was considered, and
his laurels were regarded as imperishable by his
proud master.</p>

<p>“They didn’t put me up, but if they had I’d ’a’
lost out ’side o’ him,” he remarked. “The dogs
is the smartest things in that town, an’ they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
couldn’t be no kind of a brain show thar without
’em. This dog’s a wonder. He knows the
time o’ day, an’ all the short cuts through the
woods an’ sand-hills. We ain’t neither of us got
no pedigrees, but we seem to navigate ’round
pretty well without ’em.</p>

<p>“W’en we hear any shoot’n off in the woods we
go out on a still-hunt. Casey finds the foot trails
an’ follers ’em up. ’Tain’t long ’fore we spot the
feller with the gun. Then we foregather with ’im
an’ ask fer ’is shoot’n license, an’ inspect wot ’e’s
got. If it’s song birds, er game out o’ season, we
form in line an’ perceed to whar the scales o’ justice
hang, an’ the feller has to loosen up.</p>

<p>“Casey hikes down to the depot w’en they’s
anybody that with baggage er packages, an’ sniffs
’em over. If ’e scents any birds ’e alw’ys lets me
know. I git half o’ the fines that’s levied, an’ this
’ere bag we’ve jest brought in looks like pretty
good pickin’. It’s durn poor shoot’n that don’t
shake down sump’n fer somebody. Casey an’ me
lives alone, an’ we have lots o’ long talks together.
He knows more’n most lawyers. He’s my depity,
an’ I couldn’t git along without ’im. A feller that
owns a nice new breech loadin’ gun offered to trade
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
me a horse fer ’im last week, but they was nothin’
doin’.</p>

<p>“Me an’ Casey don’t miss much that goes on
’round ’ere. After them robins is took off o’ the bar
o’ justice, we’ll fetch ’em back, if the jedge don’t
cop ’em, an’ we’ll let yer dark-spot cook ’em, an’
we’ll have a pie that’s all our own. Yer moneyed
friend c’n think about it while ’e’s in the county
jail countin’ the change ’e’s got left.”</p>

<p>It was arranged that the prisoner and his
marble-hearted captor should be taken to the
village that night in the <i>Crawfish</i>, and the journey
to the county seat made the next day.</p>

<p>The evening meal was far from festive. The
boat was poled out into the current and started
away down stream in the moonlight, with Saunders
at the helm. Sipes and the warden smoked
complacently on the roof of the cabin, and the
moody Bascom sat between them. Casey was in
charge of the evidence near the bow, where he
jealously guarded the bag of robins and kept
his eye on the evil doer.</p>

<p>Sipes had remarked to me before they left that
“things has been pretty dull ’round this ’ere
camp, but now they’s sump’n doin’.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<p>“Ah tole Mr. Bascom that ’e bettah not go
shoot’n’ much ’round heah,” said Narcissus, with
a quiet chuckle, after the party had left, “but ’e
said ’e wanted one o’ them robin pies that Mr.
Sipes tole ’im ’bout. Ah don’t remembah ’bout
no robin pie, but it might be awful good. The
wa’den has ’fiscated all them robins, an’ Ah guess
we got to fix up sump’n else fo’ dinnah tomorrow.”</p>

<p>I asked no questions when the old shipmates
returned, and they volunteered no information
as to any part that they might or might not have
played in the little drama of the afternoon, but
I suspected that the “third degree” that Sipes
had mentioned before we started was now in
process of application.</p>

<p>Justice was dealt out to Bascom with unsparing
hand when he reached the county seat, and
he was compelled to pay the full penalty of his
wrongdoing. After liquidating his fines, and incidentally
himself, in a moderate way, to drown
his troubles, he had spent an hour or so about
town, and was just taking the train, when he was
again arrested for carrying a concealed weapon.
He had neglected to leave his revolver at the
camp, and was assessed accordingly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span></p>

<p>He came back to us after three days, with a
crestfallen air, and said that he was ready to
break camp if we were. Nothing had been seen
of the Ancient or the Captain, and he regarded
it as poor strategy to stay longer, with no particular
excuse for doing so. He would devise
some other way of getting at the coy landowners.</p>

<p>We packed up our things and departed. The
engine stopped just before we reached the village,
and we found that our gasoline was exhausted.
Unfortunately the oars had been forgotten when
we left Shipmates’ Rest, but as the new motor
had worked perfectly, there had been no occasion
for them. We poled the <i>Crawfish</i> to the old pier,
landed, and stowed my little boat and tent where
we had found them. We then took the gasoline
can and walked up to the village, leaving Bascom
in charge of the <i>Crawfish</i>.</p>

<p>He was anxious for us to run across the Captain
accidentally, and if possible get him down to the
boat on some pretence. In effect, we were to
shoo the wary Captain to the ambush, where
the onion-skinner lay in wait with his tempting
yellowbacks. We did not look very hard for
him, but I happened to see him down the road
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
talking to a man in a buggy. I was not inclined
to do any shooing, and did not disturb him.</p>

<p>We spent some time in the village store. When
we came out, the sky, which had looked threatening
all the morning, was overcast with dark
angry clouds. A big storm was brewing, and we
decided not to start for Shipmates’ Rest until
it was over. There was a high off-shore wind.
The waves were rising rapidly out on the lake, but
the protected water along the bluffs was still
comparatively calm. As the wind increased we
went down to the pier, intending to tie the boat
up in a more sheltered place, and remain at the
village all night. We found to our dismay that
the <i>Crawfish</i> was adrift far out on the water.
Under the strain of the wind and the river current,
the line had parted that had held it to the
pier.</p>

<p>Bascom was gesticulating wildly for help, but
there was no means of getting to him. There
happened to be no boats around the mouth of
the river large enough to be of use in the waves
that were now breaking over the <i>Crawfish</i>. There
was no gasoline on the boat, and if there had
been oars Bascom could not have got the boat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
back with them after he got into the current.
Evidently he had not realized his danger until
it was too late to jump overboard and swim
ashore, or it may not have occurred to him.</p>

<p>“That poor feller ain’t got no more chance
’an a fish worm on a red-hot stove,” shouted
Sipes above the roar of the wind, as we watched
the helpless craft being tossed and borne away.
To do the old man justice, he forgot the boat,
and our belongings on it, in the face of Bascom’s
peril, as we all did.</p>

<p>There was a faint hope that some steamer on
the lake might rescue him, but there was none
in sight, and we doubted if the boat would stay
afloat more than a few minutes more in such a
wind and sea. Rain began to come in torrents,
and the distant object, that we had watched so
anxiously, was obliterated by the storm.</p>

<p>We made our way back to the village store
with difficulty, and telephoned to the lifesaving
station about thirty miles away on the coast,
but there was no possible hope of help from
there. There was much excitement among a few
villagers who came out into the storm, but nobody
could suggest any means of relief.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>We spent a gloomy and sleepless night in the
little town, where we were hospitably provided
for.</p>

<p>Somewhere far out on the wind-lashed lake the
turbulent seas and the storm played with a thing
that had become a part of the waste and débris
of the wide waters. Bascom’s god was in his
leather wallet, but it was powerless, except with
men. The winds and the waves knew it not.
Greed, that dominates the greater part of mankind,
becomes ghastly illusion, as the frail creature
it disfigures blends into the elements when
finality comes.</p>

<p>Mother Nature, with her invincible forces,
sometimes chastens her erring children who do
not understand. She had guarded her treasures
in Duneland through the countless years, and
now, with a breath from the skies, a destroyer
had been wafted from its portals.</p>

<p>Poor Bascom had indeed received the “third
degree” and had been “exported” in a way that
was not contemplated by the sorrowful old
sailors.</p>

<p>The storm subsided the next day and we made
the journey along the beach on foot to Shipmates’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Rest, where we found everything in good
order. We related our doleful experience to
John, and there was a cloud over our little party
for several days. Like most of the troubles in
this world, particularly when they are those of
others, the sadness of Bascom’s fate soon lost its
poignancy.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry fer Bascom,” remarked Sipes, “an’
I hate to lose the boat an’ all the stuff wot’s on it,
but Gosh, I wish I had that wad! He made a
lot o’ money in ’is business, an’ money’s all ’e
ever wanted to git, an’ ’e’s got plenty of it right
with ’im, so he ain’t got no kick comin’. He was
a hard citizen. All they was that was good about
’im was ’is cash-money, an’ it’s like that with a
lot o’ people. I don’t s’pose ’e’ll ever git anywheres
near the New Jerus’lum that Zeke tells
about, but if ’e does, I bet ’e’ll want to skin some
o’ them pearls wot’s on the gate.”</p>

<p>I arranged to leave for home, and promised to
write to Sipes if I ever saw anything in the newspapers
relating to the finding of Bascom’s body.</p>

<p>“By the way, Sipes, I never knew your first
name. What is it?”</p>

<p>“My fust name? It’s Willie, but don’t you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
never put that on no letter. Me an’ you an’
Bill’s the only ones wot knows it.”</p>

<p>I departed out of Duneland, and one cold
afternoon during the winter I opened the door
of my city studio, after a short absence, and
under it was a card that had been left during the
past hour. On it was engraved,</p>

<p>I mailed it to “Mr. W. Sipes” with a trite allusion
to bad pennies, and such other comment as
seemed befitting.</p>

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
